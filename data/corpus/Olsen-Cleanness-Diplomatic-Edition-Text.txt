Clāneſſe]  C is a decorated initial in blue with red penwork, occupying 8 lines.  Further pen squiggles (some extending the length of the folio on the very near left of the first letters of each line, some extending across the top ‘margin’ space) extend from decorated C.  Horizontal ruling for each line is visible on every folio, recto and verso, as are two vertical rulings that serve to border the text. 2. aſkeȝ]  An notes correctly that the s appears to be altered from k. 5. wonder]  woȝider TY; first minim of n resembles r, as noted by Vn;  þīg] þinges Mo, Me, Gz, Mm, An, AW, Vn, TY, G 10. reken ]  A dot and rubbing is present between the minims of the n, occurring from maroon transfer from the illustration on the facing verso, which depicts Daniel at Belshazzar’s feast.  rych⁀en] Red transfer from illustration on the facing verso over the 2nd stoke of y and curve stroke of c. 14. vtwyth  ī]  Red transfer from illustration on the facing verso over the h of vtwyth, extending over  ī. 16. cach⁀en ]  Maroon transfer from illustration on the facing verso occurs at the end of this line, after cach⁀en.  b⁀oþe] loþe Me, Vn 17. cote] courte Mo, Gz, Mm, An, AW, Vn, TY; corte Me

Many words between lines 26 and 36 are difficult to read, because of fading and rubbing damage. 30. auwh⁀ere ab⁀owte ]  Rubbing damage makes wte difficult to discern.  33. hyȝ]  An requires uv to distinguish ȝ, but the reading is clear in the MS without it (especially with magnification). 34. ne ī]  The cross-stroke of e is exaggerated, extending to meet the abbreviation stroke above i.  35. h⁀aþel]  The compartment of þ is completely rubbed; el are very blurred, perhaps due to rubbing. 36. attyred]  The horizontal of the first t is significantly taller than the second (and usual forms of t in this MS), making the letter resemble f. British Museum stamp occurs at bottom centre of folio.

The w is in a different hand than that of the text scribe, as it is more elaborately flourished than the text scribe’s form of w
