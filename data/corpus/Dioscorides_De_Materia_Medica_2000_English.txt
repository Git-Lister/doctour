    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

Narthecium ossifragum
after FAGUET — 1888

EDITORIAL PREFACE
Pedanius Dioscorides the Greek wrote this De Materia
Medica approximately two thousand years ago. In
1655 John Goodyer made an English translation from a
manuscript copy, and in 1933 Robert T Gunther edited
this, Hafner Publishing Co, London & New York,
printing it. This was probably not corrected against the
Greek, and this version of Goodyer's Dioscorides makes
no such attempt either.   
The purpose of this new edition is to offer a more
accessible text to today’s readers, as the  ‘english-ed’ copy
by Goodyer is generously endowed with post-medieval
terminology and is presently out of print. The reader may 
wish to refer to Greek, Latin, or other versions —
including these lies beyond the scope of the present
effort. I have not attempted to make the text uniform, and 
though I have  included some sixteenth-century and
Linnaean names, many do not indicate current usage.
While it is not my intention to contribute to the
controversy surrounding the true identities of the plants,
minerals, and creatures in De Materia Medica , where
available I have suggested possible plant names, with an
indication of other plants using the same name today. I
will appreciate any pertinent information that has been
overlooked, and wish to acknowledge the errors that
remain. Thus the proposed herbs provide some
possibilities, and the reader is invited to place a personal
interpretation upon the material. The illustrations
suggest further options in some instances.
Dioscorides’ treatise is not offered as a primary
resource for medical treatment. Readers should in the
first instance obtain medical advice from qualified,
registered health professionals. Many treatments
considered acceptable two thousand years ago are
useless or harmful. This particularly applies to the
abortifacients mentioned in the manuscript, most of
which contain toxins considered dangerous in the
required doses. With all this in mind, I believe the
information in this document is still of interest and
benefit to us, after all this time.

Bursera gummifera
after FAGUET— 1888

ORIGINAL DEDICATION
Dearest Areius, 
Although many of the writers nowadays, as well as
those in ancient times, wrote discourses on the
preparations, strengths and dosage of drugs, I will
attempt to prove to you that I did not choose to
undertake this through vanity or impulsiveness. Some of
those authors did not complete their attempts, while
others copied previous historical documents. Iolas from
Bithynia and Hexaclides from Tarentum briefly
considered the subject but they completely omitted any
systematic discussion of herbs and ignored metals and
spices. Crateuas the rhizotomist and Andreas the
physician seem to have had greater knowledge of this
particular area than most, but have ignored many
extremely useful roots and gave meagre descriptions of
many herbs. Still I must admit that although they told us
little, the ancients applied great effort in their work. I am
not completely in agreement with most modern writers,
among them Julius Bassus, Niceratus and Petronius,
Niger and Diodotus, who are all asclepiads [poets]. In a
way they have condescended to describe commonplace
information familiar to all but they have explained the
strengths of medicines and their properties briefly, not
considering their value by personal experience, but by
worthless discussion created needless controversy
regarding each medicine, and in addition they have
mistakenly recorded one thing for another. So Niger,
who it seems is a man of importance among them,
declares euphorbion to be the juice of a chamelaia that
grows in Italy; androsaimon is considered the same as
hypericon; and aloe is a mineral found in Judea; and in the
face of contradictory evidence he reports an abundance
of untruths, which proves that he obtained his
information from erroneous gossip, not from personal
experience. Additionally they have erred in the
categorisation of medicines: some associate those of quite 
different powers, others establish an alphabetical system
in their discussions and thus separate types and activities
of materials that are similar, so that they become  harder
to remember. From my youth I have had an unceasing
inquisitiveness regarding knowledge of this subject, and
I have travelled widely (as you know, I was a soldier), so I
 viii
ORIGINAL DEDICATION

after FAGUET— 1888


have taken your advice and assembled all that I have
discussed and have written it down in five books. I
dedicate this collection to you, as a token of my grateful
appreciation for the friendship you have shown me. You
are always a ready friend to anyone obsessed by
knowledge, particularly in this profession, and even
more especially to myself. It is  clear from the love that
wonderful man Licinius Bassus has for you, that you
express a loving benevolence that I experienced (I
noticed when I stayed with you, the unsurpassing
generosity that you shared). I ask that you and all who
may read these discussions will not consider so much the
value of my words as the effort and practical work that I
have based the work on. With careful investigation —
since I know many plants personally, and others from
previous writings that are generally approved of — and
patiently inquiring (by questioning the local inhabitants)
about each type of plant, I will attempt a different
classification, and also try to explain the varieties and
uses of each one of them. Obviously we can agree that a
systematic discourse on medicines is necessary, as this is
the basis of the entire profession of healing and gives
considerable aid to every discipline. So that the scope
may fully cover methods of preparation, compounds,
and tests on illnesses, and because information about
each individual drug is necessary for this, I intend to
assimilate things that are common knowledge and those
that are somehow related so that the information will be
exhaustive. First it is necessary to pay attention to storing
and gathering plants, and only at the proper harvest
time, for unless care is taken drugs can either be potent or
become useless. Herbs should be collected on a sunny
day, as it matters considerably if it is raining when the
harvest is gathered. The places they grow also matter;
specific medicinal herbs are stronger or weaker if found
on hills and mountains; if exposed to winds; if their
position is cool and arid — their strength can rest entirely
on such conditions. Healing herbs located in the open or
in bogs and dark places that do not permit the circulation
of air are generally of poorer strength, particularly if they
are collected at the wrong time, or are rotten and of
inferior quality. We must remember that plants often
mature sooner or are delayed depending on the
peculiarities of the locale and the variability of the
seasons, and although certain herbs by their very nature
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK
 xi

are winter-growing and -flowering, some may flower more
than once a year. It is essential that someone wanting to be
an accomplished herbalist should observe the first new
growths of the herbs as well as their mature expression and
their eventual decline. Otherwise a person seeing only a
new shoot will be unable to identify the same flourishing
plant, and having seen only its full growth will not know
the seedling. Due to varieties in the forms of leaves, the
proportions of stems, and the appearances of  flowers and
fruits and certain other familiar features, those who have
neglected careful examination in the right manner have
committed serious errors. This is why certain writers have
erred grievously in their discussions of certain herbs —
saying that they have no stalks, fruit or flowers —
mentioning gramen, tussilago, and quinquefolium.  So the
individual who continually examines plants growing in
different localities will learn the most about them.
Furthermore, it is important to note that among medicinal
herbs only black and white hellebore keep their potency for
a long time. Most other plants are viable for up to three
years. Branching plants such as stoechas, chamaidrus, potion,
abrotanum, seriphium, absinthium and hyssopum etc., must be
harvested when they are full of seed; flowers must be
collected while still on the plant; fruits must be allowed to
ripen; and seeds should be starting to dry, but still on the
plant. To express the plant liquids, use stems and leaves that 
are new. To harvest saps and resins make incisions in the
mature stalks. To collect roots for storage or to press out
their liquids or to remove their coverings, wait until the
leaves start to fall off the plant. Clean roots can be stored
right away in places that are not damp, however any soil
adhering to the roots should be rinsed off with water.
Blossoms and perfumed materials must be kept in dry
limewood boxes but certain plants are adequately stored in
paper or leaf wrappings to protect the seeds. Preparations
that contain moisture require substantial containers from
materials such as silver, glass or horn. Even thick ceramic
containers are acceptable, and even wood, especially
boxwood. Brass receptacles are ideal  for eye medicines,
liquids, and preparations including vinegar, liquid pitch or
cedria [oil of cedar]; but fats and marrow should be stored in
tin boxes.

    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK
 xix

INTRODUCTION
PEDIANOS DIOSCORIDES
THE MAN  
Pedianos Dioscorides, also known as Pedanius
Dioskourides, probably lived between 40CE and 90CE 
in the time of the Roman Emperors Nero and Vespasian.
A Cilician Greek, he was born in Anazarbos (now
Nazarba, near Tarsus) within the Roman Empire of the
day, and today in Turkey. A learned physician, he
practiced medicine as an army doctor, and saw service
with the Roman legions in Greece, Italy, Asia Minor, and
Provence in modern-day France. His military years
provided opportunities for studying diseases, collecting
and identifying medicinal plants, and discovering other
healing materials. Dioscorides compiled his medical
treatise at the suggestion of a fellow-physician, Areius.
He had access to the library at Alexandria, and may have
studied at Tarsus. He recorded many plants previously
unknown to Greek and Roman physicians, and made an
effort to describe not only their qualities and remedial
effects, but also something of their botany and living
morphology — including roots, foliage, and sometimes
flowers. Although not as naïve as many other herbal
writers, he showed little scientific interest —
concentrating rather on the practical uses of plants —
and sometimes giving only brief descriptions, perhaps
from other primary souces. In all he described some one
thousand remedies using approximately six hundred
plants and plant products. 
Dioscorides probably wrote his great herbal in about
64CE (according to Pritzel 77 CE). These medicinal and
alimentary plants number about a hundred more plants
than all those (medicinal or not) known to the great
botanist Theophrastus, and described in his fine
botanical work, the Enquiry into Plants , some two
centuries before. Theophrastus of Eresos (a village on the
Greek island of Lesbos) lived from about 372 to 286BCE. A
pupil of Plato and close friend of Aristotle, he is the
earliest known systematic botanical author in Europe. He

discussed about 500 plants (or plant products) familiar at
that time, including almost forty plants still used in
medicine today, and mentioned plants from all regions of 
the known world, including India, Egypt and Cyrenaica,
possibly discovered during the military campaigns of
Alexander the Great. Theophrastus drew on the work of
Diokles of Karystos (about 300 BCE), a fellow-student of
Aristotle. 
Dioscorides added extensively to the range of plants
used in medicine. He was a contemporary of the Roman,
Pliny, whose monumental work on natural history (the
history of the world) mentions about 1000 different
plants. There is no evidence that they met, and Pliny may
not have read Dioscorides' work. Gaius Plinius Secundus, 
known as Pliny the Elder, was born in Como in 23CE and
died in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE. A busy
Roman official, Pliny was also a prolific author, though
only the thirty-seven books of his Historia Naturalis
survived. He transcribed the knowledge of his time in
accurate and precise detail, uncritically adding myths,
legends, superstitions, personal observations, and
opinions in a discursive, entertaining, encyclopaedic
work. Pliny is less systematic and more credulous than
Dioscorides. Pliny's remedies while no more effective are
generally more unpleasant. 
For almost two millenia Dioscorides was regarded as
the ultimate authority on plants and medicine. The plant
descriptions in his Περι υληζ ιατρικη 1 or De Materia
Medica were often adequate for identification, including
methods of preparation, medicinal uses, and dosages.
There is also a minor work bearing the name of
Dioscorides, Περι απλων φαρµακων2, but this may not be
authentic. Recognising the usefulness of his medical
botany and phytography, his readers probably
overestimated their worth. In truth, Theophrastus was
the scientific botanist; Pliny produced the systematic
encyclopaedia of knowledge; and Dioscorides was
merely a medical botanist. However Dioscorides

achieved overwhelming commendation and approval
because his writings addressed the many ills of mankind
most usefully.
   
 THE TEACHINGS
Dioscorides was one of the first writers to emphasize
observing plants in their native habitats, and at all stages
of growth. De Materia Medica also instructs on collecting,
using, and storing drugs from vegetable, animal and
mineral sources. There are about seventy animal-product 
remedies, including two using vipers' flesh, a famous
poison antidote. This snake meat (pickled in oil, wine, salt 
and dill) was also recommended for sharpening eyesight, 
and for nerves. A popular remedial delicacy mentions
viper roasted with salt, honey, figs and nardostachys
(spikenard), and made into a soup. Dioscorides' plant
descriptions use an elementary classification, though he
cannot be said to have used botanical taxonomy. Book
One discusses aromatic plants; growths that provide oily, 
gummy or resinous products for use in salves and
ointments; then the fleshy fruits, even if not aromatic.
Book Two begins with animal products of dietetic and
medicinal use, continuing with cereals and leguminous,
malvaceous, cruciferous and other garden herbs. Book
Three covers roots, juices, herbs and seeds used for food
or medicine; and Book Four includes narcotic and
poisonous medicinal plants. Book Five mentions vines,
wines and metallic ores. Dioscorides does not adopt
Theophrastus' philosophic treatment of plants, nor his
classification using botanical characteristics. Dioscorides'
qualitative classification (properties and uses) suits his
medicinal purposes. Nevertheless, when necessary, he
classifies separately; such as Sambucus where he
distinguishes one species as a herb and the other as
woody, almost a tree. He also recognises the familiar
natural families of plants such as the labiate genera, the
leguminous, the umbelliferous, the composites and the
solanaceous plants. 
Together with Pliny's encyclopaedic writings,
Dioscorides' De Materia Medica  provides important
documentation about drugs in the early Roman Empire,
as well as offering interesting insights into daily life. For
example, the Romans used green twigs of  Pistacia
 xxii
INTRODUCTION

lentiscus for brushing teeth; they made henna shampoo
by pounding henna leaves soaked in the juice of
soapwort; other yellow hair-dyes came from Rhamnus,
Zizyphus and Xanthium; and black hair-dyes from gum
arabica, oak, oak galls, Rhus, myrtle, ivy, Salvia species
and Sambucus ebulus . They blackened eyebrows and
eyelashes with vegetable soot from the burnt resin of
coniferae. They used oil from wild olives to stop falling
hair, and keep it from turning grey; and made hair tonic
from a mixture of myrrh, ladanum, myrtle oil and wine.
Bear grease was said to make hair grow again; and they
used a creamy extract of fenugreek flour for cleaning
hair. Cleansing and beautifying lotions for the
complexion included Sicyonian oil, almond oil, mastic oil, 
oil of fenugreek, oil of bitter almonds, fats of geese and
poultry, lizard dung, Sardinian honey, bitter vetch flour,
lupin flour, and juice from a gourd or vegetable marrow.
Latex from Euphorbia characias was mixed with oil for a
depilatory. Much as we do today, cosmetics and
medicines were prepared side by side in Roman times,
and sold in the same shop. The ordinary name for a
druggist's shop was seplasia; within the shop the
seplasiarii were ointment-makers, and the pigmentarii sold 
dyes and colours. In time the two designations became
interchangeable. 
In his original introduction Dioscorides states that
many physicians provided superficial accounts of the
properties and diagnostic uses of drugs, often confusing
one plant with another. Pliny the Elder confirms that
physicians of his day knew little about compounding
medications, entrusting these matters to seplasiarii, who
frequently supplied spoiled or adulterated drugs. We
learn from Fuchs that even in the sixteenth century
hardly any contemporary physicians in Germany valued
accurate knowledge of medicinal plants. This
information did not concern them and was beneath their
dignity — they left the study of medicinal plants to the
superstitious, the foolish and old peasant women. 
Dioscorides also discusses adulteration, frequently
mentioning methods of falsification or substitution, and
means of detection.  For example, root of valeriana was
adulterated with butcher's broom, which might be
noticed because it became hard, difficult to break, and
lacked a pleasant smell; and frankincense was frequently
adulterated with pine resin and gum. De Materia Medica
 xxiii
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

discusses the preparation of oils and unguents at length.
Spissamenta (astringents) were added to preserve and
thicken oil, and make it retain desired perfumes from
odoramenta (aromatic herbs, aromata). Various forms of
medication included acopa, cataplasmata, malagmata,
eclegmata and catapotia . An acopum was a soothing or
stimulatory liniment. Cataplasmata were plasters or
poultices. Malagmata were emollient poultices. An eclegma
(electuary or looch) was a thick syrup to be swallowed
slowly. Catapotia were pills coated with wax or honey.
Dioscorides mentions mandragora (mandrake), used as an 
anaesthetic for amputation or surgery — the patient
became ‘ overborn with dead sleep’ 3 so that the surgeon
could painlessly  ‘cut or cauterise’ 4. Dioscorides used the
Greek word  anaesthesia for insensitivity , a term
reintroduced in the nineteenth century. 
We find several amusing anecdotes about plants in De 
Materia Medica. The mandrake was associated with
various myths, presumably because the thick tuberous
roots resemble the human form. Dogs were used to
extract this, as it allegedly screamed when pulled from
the ground, deafening human gatherers. No doubt this
tale intimidated casual collectors and protected the wild
species. It contains hyoscyamine, an anaesthetic used
until the introduction of ether in 1846. The nightshades
(circaea and solanum species), employed by eminent
poisoners through the centuries, were used to treat
numerous ailments including hayfever. Medicinal
drinking-cups were made from the wood of Tamarix
gallica, and liquid left standing in them was considered
beneficial for disorders of the spleen. In the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries this practice was renewed with
drinking-cups made from  Lignum nephriticum , which
gave a brilliant blue fluorescence to water, highly
regarded as a specific for diseases of the kidneys. 
Painkillers have always dominated healing texts.
Dioscorides wrote of the willow — itea, probably salix
species — ‘a decoction of them is an excellent fomentation for
ye gout ’5. In due course this knowledge led German

scientists to aspirin. Dioscorides also mentions autumn
crocus, another painkiller, warning of its dangers. The
world's best-known painkiller is undoubtedly opium,
mentioned in the Ebers Papyrus  (an Egyptian medical
book dating from about 1550 BCE), as well as by
Theophrastus. Dioscorides describes harvesting opium
— the same method is still used today for collecting the
coagulated juice of the poppy heads. The gummy
exudate was called  opium by the Greeks, this merely
being a word for juice. Although a wonderful painkiller,
opium is a dangerous narcotic. Dioscorides warned ‘ a
little of it, taken as much as a grain of ervum (probably seed of 
ervil, a vetch), is a pain-easer, and a sleep-causer, and a
digester ... but being drank too much it hurts, making men
lethargicall, and it kills’6. 
Dioscorides describes many valuable drugs including
aconite, aloes, bitter apple, colchicum, henbane, and
squill. Minor drugs, diluents, flavouring agents, and
emollients still in some modern pharmacopoeia include
ammoniacum, anise, cardamoms, catechu, cinnamon,
colocynth, coriander, crocus, dill, fennel, galbanum,
gentian, hemlock, hyoscyamus, lavender, linseed, mastic, 
male fern, marjoram, marshmallow, mezereon, mustard,
myrrh, orris (iris),  oak galls, olive oil, pennyroyal,
pepper, peppermint, poppy, psyllium, rhubarb,
rosemary, rue, saffron, sesame, squirting cucumber
(elaterium), starch, stavesacre (delphinium), storax,
stramonium, sugar, terebinth, thyme, white hellebore,
white horehound,  and couch grass — the last still used as 
a demulcent diuretic. A decoction of pomegranate root
bark is prescribed to expel tapeworm. Other medicines
still in use include wormwood, pine bark, juniper, ginger, 
almond oil, cherry syrup and calamine. Chinese and
Indian physicians continue to use liquorice, also known
to the ancient Egyptians, and mentioned in De Materia
Medica.
Specifics for women include several to procure
abortions; as well as treatments for infections of the
urinogenital tract; and palliatives for stomach ache and
intestinal pains. Dioscorides, no doubt familiar with the
prevalence of skin and eyes diseases in the Near East,
 xxv

6 ibid. 4-65, p458.

included many remedies for these. Chronic malaria,
possibly a factor in the decline of the Roman Empire, may 
justify the many medications to reduce the spleen.
Palliatives for toothache included colocynth; the resin of
Commiphora species; the bark of Platanus soaked in
vinegar; a decoction of tamarisk leaves mixed with wine;
oak-galls; the resin of Rhus; a decoction of the leaves and
bark of mulberry; the latex of the fig; that of Euphorbia
characias mixed with oil; the roots of Rumex (the weed,
dock) in vinegar; and a decoction of the roots of
asparagus and Plantago (plantain). Sediment of olive oil
mixed with juice from unripe grapes and cooked to the
consistency of honey, was smeared on decayed teeth to
loosen them. The Egyptians prepared a kind of beer
called zythum or zythus from barley; and Dioscorides tells
us ivory soaked in this becomes easily workable. Large
slabs of ivory were carved by ancient artists — the secret
of their softening method is now lost.
A few superstitious practices are recorded in De
Materia Medica. Amulets and mascots were valued, such
as Anchusa alia (Echium species) used as an amulet against
snakes; and Polemonia against the bite of scorpions. The
third joint from the ground of the stem of Verbena
(vervain) was used for tertian fevers; and the fourth joint
for quartian fevers.  Black hellebore was dug up with
great care lest an eagle observe the act, as this would
cause death. Dioscorides also recounts the myth of
Lysippe and lphianassa, daughters of the King of Argos,
who recovered from madness, noting they were healed
with black hellebore.
THE WRITINGS — MANUSCRIPTS
Ancient herbal traditions claimed plants were the
flesh of the gods, who instructed men in their proper use.
The earliest fragmentary herbal records are Egyptian,
Sumerian, and Chinese — Emperor Shen Nung
composed the Pen T'sao Ching  about 2700 BCE; medical
prescriptions are listed on a 5000 year-old Sumerian
tablet; and the earliest surviving herbal is the Papyrus
Ebers from about 1550 BCE, containing material gathered
five to twenty centuries before. The earliest herbal writers 
we can name are Greek — Theophrastus, with his
Enquiry into Plants  of 350 BCE; Hippocrates; Diokles of
Caryustus; Krateuas and his contemporary the Roman
 xxvi
INTRODUCTION

Sextius Niger (first century BCE); Nicander of Colophon
(second century BCE); and Nicolaus of Damascenus with
his De Plantis of about 30BCE. Krateuas is the first noted
instance of both author and artist.
The earliest surviving records of illustrated Greek
Herbals indicate De Materia Medica was widely read and
reproduced during the Middle Ages in Latin, Arabic and
Greek. For fifteen hundred years it was the standard
authority both in botany and materia medica, assuming
considerable significance in the development of western
and Islamic cultures. The great paradigm for botany is
that the history of botany before 1700 was really the
history of pharmacy. Had printing existed then, it is
possible Dioscorides' overwhelming influence would
have confined later writings on the subject to glossaries
on De Materia Medica . As it was, most herbalists were
heavily indebted to him, just as he had drawn from
authorities before him. De Materia Medica may be partially 
based on the lost work of Diokles (called Hippocrates II
by his contemporaries), which  dealt with hygiene and
prophylaxis, and gave detailed instructions for sound
living7.
The physician Galen, an influential Greek writer in
the development of the herbal, cited Dioscorides. Galen's
De Simplicibus,   prepared around the year 180 CE, dealt
with medicine, pharmacy, and drugs, giving the name,
locality, and uses for each plant. The Greek Oribasios
[325-403CE] produced the popular manuscripts Synagoge
and Euporista, drawing freely from both Dioscorides and
Galen, and being translated into Latin. A concise
manuscript of western Roman origin,  Herbarium Apulei
Platonici, was well-regarded in late Roman times. Its 150
illustrations include some of Greek provenance, mainly
from manuscripts based on De Materia Medica.  In the
Dark Ages these herbal manuscripts lost some influence
to simpler herbals, the creative period of Greek science
having passed. The earliest copies of Dioscorides'
manuscript were not illustrated. The oldest survival is a
fragment, the Michigan Papyrus. 
The finest surviving comprehensive manuscript
copy, magnificently illustrated, was made in the sixth

century in Constantinople [about 512CE] and is known as
Codex Vindobonensis. The citizens of Honoratae, a suburb
of Byzantium in Turkey, presented it as a birthday gift to
their Christian patroness  Patricia Juliana Anicia,
daughter of Flavius Anicius Olybrius, Emperor of the
West briefly in 472CE. This was in appreciation for Juliana 
Anicia having arranged the construction and decoration
of a church dedicated to Polyeuktos, a martyr.  The
manuscript is on vellum, written in Greek uncials  in the
tradition of early sixth-century calligraphy. Alternate
plant names in many languages were probably added to
the manuscript from the work of Alexandrian
lexicographer Pamphilos in the first century CE. These
synonyms are provided in African, Andreae medici ,
Armenian, Bessicum, Boeotian, Cappadocian, Dacian,
Dardana, Democriti, Egyptian, Ethiopian, Gaulish,
Spanish, Istrici, Lucanica, Marsum, Osthanis, Prophetae,
Pythagorean, Roman, Tuscan, and Zoroastrian. The
coloured paintings of plants date from the second
century CE. They are splendid and reveal a naturalism
alien to Byzantine art of the time; some are remarkably
life-like with accurate colour, but others vary in quality,
the level of botanical observation frequently inadequate.
Eleven items are clearly derived from the writings and
drawings of Krateuas (Cratevas), pharmacologist and
physician to Mithridates VI Eupator, King of Pontus from 
120 to 63BCE. Codex Vindobonensis is a large book, roughly
thirty centimeters square, of four hundred and ninety
one parchment sheets, with nearly four hundred
full-page paintings of plants, and some smaller ones of
birds. Many plants discussed are indigenous to Greece
and the eastern Mediterranean, or cultivated as edible
crops. The first pages of Codex Vindobonensis have smaller
paintings, including one showing Dioscorides at work
while Intelligence holds up a mandrake for Krateuas to
draw. Some paintings are quite skilful, handling
awkward details such as how the leaf-bases clasp the
stem; fine-leaved plants such as fennel are well drawn;
other beautiful illustrations include cyclamen,
wormwood, delphinium, scarlet pimpernel, and
asphodel. In this Codex an alphabetic extract of the
original text is given.
Nearly nine centuries pass before we next hear of the
manuscript. In 1406 it was rebound by John
Chortasmenos for Nathanael, a monk and physician in
 xxviii
INTRODUCTION

the Prodromos Monastery in Constantinople. After the
Muslim conquest in 1453 the manuscript fell to the Turks.
A century later a Jew named Hamon, body physician to
Suleiman the Magnificent, owned it. In 1562 Augier
Ghislain de Busbecq, ambassador from the Emperor
Ferdinand of Habsburg to the Sublime Porte saw and
coveted it, and reported its existence. He wrote that he
could not buy it because he had been asked one hundred
ducats, a sum too large for his pocket. Seven years later
the manuscript found its way through the good offices of
Ferdinand's successor, Maximillian II, into the Imperial
Library in Vienna (now the Bibliothek Nationale ). Codex
Vindobonensis  is probably the earliest, most splendid, and
most important illustrated herbal manuscript of classical
times. Before conveying it to the Imperial Library, de
Busbecq lent it to Mattioli who drew heavily on it for
commentaries on De Materia Medica.  Master printer
Christoffel Plantin used illustrations from  Codex
Vindobonensis for herbals published in the late sixteenth
century for Dodoens, Clusius, Lobelius, and Lyte. 
There are many surviving manuscripts of De Materia
Medica after Codex Vindobonensis — an important example 
being the seventh-century Greek alphabetic  Codex
Neapolitanus, in the possession of a Neapolitan monastery 
for many years, and then presented to Emperor Charles
VI in 1717. It was taken to Vienna and subsequently to the 
Bibliotheca Nazionale  in Naples. The drawings in Codex
Neapolitanus are from the same source as Codex
Vindobonensis, but are smaller and grouped together on
fewer pages. A good copy of the Codex Vindobonensis from 
the fifteenth century is in the Cambridge University
library; there is a line of descent to a fourteenth century
manuscript, Paris GR 2091;  and a seventeenth century
descendant at Bologna — these four forming the primary
alphabetic group. The secondary alphabetic group
includes eleventh- and twelfth-century manuscripts at
Pierpoint Morgan, Mount Atlas and the Vatican (GR 284).
Next is the non-alphabetic Greek group, the best example 
the Paris Grec 2179 in the Bibliotheque Nationale, written in
ninth-century Egypt, its naturalistic illustrations dating
the draughtsmanship to the second or third century CE.
Later manuscripts of the same group reside at Venice (St
Marks 273 of the eleventh century), Florence, the Vatican,
and Vienna.

    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

The Ostrogoths and Lombards encouraged Latin
translations. The ninth-century Dioscorides Lombardus in
the Munchener Staatsbibliothek (with its direct descendant,
a South Italian manuscript in Beneventan script,  Codex
Longobard, Munich 337) has an excellent text, making it the 
most important of the Latin manuscripts. It is illustrated
with approximately 900 lovely miniatures, more than
twice as many as the 387 in  Codex Vindobonensis .
Herbarium Apulei (Codex Cassinensis 97 ), a ninth-century
manuscript herbal from the late Roman period (about
400CE) preserved at the Abbey of Monte Cassino in Italy,
is based partly on Dioscorides Lombardus. Dioscorides
Vulgaris ( Palimpsest Lat 16 ), a sixth-century manuscript
now in Vienna, is the second primary Latin translation.
Up to the seventeenth century we find many
commentaries and inferior later manuscripts such as Liber 
Dioscuridis de herbis feminis by Sextus Placitus Papyriensis. 
Dioscorides Lombardus was one of the source documents
(with 22 others) for the celebrated botanical poem Macer
floridus of 1161 by Odo of Meune. He recounts the virtues
of 77 plants in verse dedicated to Aemilius Macer, a
contemporary and friend of Ovid. Dioscorides Vulgaris led 
to a number of further versions, one with Anglo-Saxon
glossaries.
Arabic/Muslim medical scholars rose to prominence
during the fifth to twelfth centuries, with Arabic the new
language of learning, and many Greek works translated
into Arabic from Syriac. In the ninth century monasteries,  
such as the Benedictine at Monte Cassino and St Gallen
on Lake Constance, became centres of herbalism in
Europe. Arabic and monastic writings drew heavily on
Dioscorides and Pliny. Arabic works were also translated
into Latin, such as the twelfth-century herbal of Johannes 
Serapion the younger (Ibn Sarabiyun), translated by
Simon Januensis and Abraham ben Shemtob, in about
1292. Quoting extensively from Dioscorides and Galen,
this was published as Liber Serapionis aggregatus in
medicinis simplicibus, Milan, 1473.
In the Dark and Middle Ages Nestorian Christians
banished for heretical views carried the works of
Dioscorides and others to Asia Minor. The Greek text was
translated into Syriac when pagan Greek scholars fled
east after Constantine’s conquest of Byzantium.
Stephanos (son of Basilios, a Christian living in Baghdad
under the Khalif Motawakki) made an Arabic translation
 xxx
INTRODUCTION

of De Materia Medica from the Greek in 854 CE. In 948 CE
the Byzantine Emperor Romanus II, son and co-regent of
Constantine Porphyrogenitos, sent a beautifully
illustrated Greek manuscript of De Materia Medica to the
Spanish Khalif, Abd-Arrahman III. Spaniards were
unfamiliar with Greek, so in 951 CE a learned monk,
Nicolas, arrived in Spain so that physicians in Cordoba
might be taught Greek. Nicolas and his Arabic-speaking
pupils then prepared a new corrected edition. The Syriac
scholar Bar Hebraeus prepared an illustrated Syriac
version in 1250, which was translated into Arabic. An
Arabic translation from the eleventh century in the
Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris (Codex arab. 4947) shows how
faithfully the Arabs reproduced the Greek illustrations.
Arabic modifications rendered the figures more
symmetrical, achieving naturalistic fidelity. A Persian
translation from the thirteenth century is preserved in
the Shrine at Meshed, Iran; and an Arabic Dioscorides is
in the Bodleian Library. A richly-illustrated Arabic
Dioscorides manuscript of 1224 ( Codex 2148) in the Top
Kapu Saray Museum has exquisitely detailed figurative
scenes. A number of other illustrated Arabic manuscripts
of De Materia Medica  are known. The teachings of
Dioscorides have been used in the practice of medicine in
the Middle East from their first writing to the present
day. 
 
THE WRITINGS — PRINTED BOOKS
The first printed herbals appearing in the fifteenth
century relied on ancient authors for texts. The
accessibility and standardisation of these works
perpetuated the influence of these venerable authors.
Three herbal incunabulae (books printed before 1500)
have a particularly interesting derivation.  The Herbarius
of 1484, the Gart der Gesundheit  of 1485, and the Ortus
Sanitatus of 1491, all printed in Mainz, were compiled
from works by Matthaeus Sylvaticus, Serapio, Avicenna,
Platearius, Dioscorides, Galen, and others. Dioscorides
was mentioned sixteen times in the Herbarius, 242 times
in the Gart, and 570 times in the Ortus. The first printed
book of Dioscorides’ De Materia Medica  is a rare and
obscure Latin translation of the Dioscoridis Vulgaris
printed at Colle, near Siena, Tuscany, by Johannem
Allemanum de Medem blik in 1478. In 1499 Aldus
 xxxi
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

Manutius printed the first Greek version in Venice. Latin
editions were numerous, particularly the excellent
translation by the Frenchman Jean de la Ruelle, Latin
being the new language of scholarship. In the following
century the most voluminous and useful books of botany
were supplemented commentaries on Dioscorides,
including the works of Fuchs, Anguillara, Mattioli,
Maranta, Cesalpino, Dodoens, Fabio Colonna, and the
Bauhins. In several the annotations and comments
exceed the Dioscoridean text and have much new
botany. Nonetheless it seems that a considerable part of
all new botanical matter published in the sixteenth and
part of the seventeenth centuries consisted largely of
annotations on the texts of Dioscorides.
Numerous herbals published from 1473 onwards
were directly or indirectly based on Dioscoridean
manuscripts. From 1478 there were many Latin editions.
A Greek version  was published at Venice in 1499, and
reprinted in 1518, 1523 and 1529. Between 1555 and 1752
there were at least twelve Spanish editions; and as many
in Italian from 1542. French editions appeared from 1553;
and German editions from 1546. Some copies of the work
appear decadent, with a loss of faithfulness to the earlier
text; certain later editions exhibit the freshness and
accuracy of the Codex Vindobonensis , notably the
illustrated volume by Mattioli in 1544. 
Pier Andrea Mattioli (1500 to 1577), a  renowned
botanist and physician, translated De Materia Medica into
vernacular Italian as Di Pedacio Dioscoride Anazarbeo libri
cinque … ,  Venice 1544. An illustrated edition in Latin
followed: Commentarii in sex libros Pedacii Dioscoridis de
medica materia,  Venice 1554. In this imposing plant
encyclopaedia Mattioli identified Dioscorides’ plants and 
added 562 woodcut illustrations. Mattioli experimented
on prisoners to determine the lethal thresholds of various 
poisonous plants, ensuring the medical popularity of his
books.  Besides the Italian editions the work appeared in
Latin, Bohemian , French, and German. Mattioli wrote
other books but his commentaries on Dioscorides (said to
run to forty editions) are considered his most important
work, leading to his appointment to the Imperial Court as 
physician to Archduke Ferdinand I, and later to the
Emperor Maximilian II. Mattioli, obsessed with
Dioscorides, set out to be the supreme authority on his
idol, tolerating neither rivals nor corrections. He wielded
 xxxii
INTRODUCTION

immense influence throughout Europe. Any physician or 
naturalist daring to disagree with him was abused. Both
Amatus Lusitanus and Luigi Anguillara lost their posts,
the former being hounded by the Inquisition. Konrad
Gesner, Marant and Wieland were rebuked. Over the
years Mattioli's commentaries overwhelmed De Materia
Medica — for example on acorus (Iris pseudacorus )
Dioscorides wrote seven lines, and Mattioli 140 lines.
Forty years later a physician at Nuremberg, Johann
Camerarius II (1534 to 1598), re-edited and enlarged
Mattioli’s work as De plantis epitome ...,  Frankfurt 1586,
replacing the illustrations with superior woodcuts. 
In the time of Queen Elizabeth I the pharmacopoeia
rested on the unquestioned authority of the ancient
physician Dioscorides. Even in the middle of the
seventeenth century, John Goodyer (1592 to 1644)
thought it worthwhile to make the first English
translation of the whole work. This translation, written
out in Goodyer's small and careful handwriting, filled
four and a half thousand  pages, taking three years to
complete. John Sibthorp (1758 to 1796) used Goodyer's
English Codex for his Flora Graeca  (1806-1840) 8; and
Gunther's edition of Goodyer's translation was printed 
in 19349, and reprinted in 1959. This is the only English
edition, apart from the present version in contemporary
English by Tess Anne Osbaldeston. In the late eighteenth
century John Sibthorp came to Vienna with John
Hawkins to study the Codex Vindobonensis . He met the
talented Austrian artist Ferdinand Bauer through the von 
Jacquins, and together they made a Grand Tour of the
Levant — including Crete, through the Aegean to
Smyrna (Izmur), Constantinople, inland to Belgrade, as
well as Cyprus and Greece — to find Dioscorides'
medicinal plants. Their efforts resulted in the magnificent
Flora Graeca, uncompleted for fifty two years, and then
only with the help of Sir John Edward Smith, Robert

Brown, John Lindley and the Sowerbys. Thus eighteen
hundred years after compiling De Materia Medica ,
Dioscorides' medical work led to the publication of one of 
England's most sumptuous works on botany, ‘perhaps one
of the most magnificent floras ever produced’,  according to
Martyn Rix in  The Art of the Plant World 10. A fairly
comprehensive list of printed versions of De Materia
Medica is given elsewhere in this volume, together with
works based on, or derived from it.
THE ASSESSMENTS
Julius von Sachs virtually ignored Dioscorides'
contribution to botany in his authoritative History of
Botany 1530-1860 . In the wide-ranging Guide to the
Literature of Botany  Benjamin Daydon Jackson accuses
Dioscorides of causing endless discussion and confusion
among his followers, contending his meagre plant
descriptions cannot be dignified by that term — ‘his
various treatises formed the staple of the discourses and
wranglings of the early botanists of the Renaissance’11 until the 
appearance of Sibthorp's Flora of Greece . This ‘ contention
was probably caused by the extreme meagreness of the original
descriptions ... so that the fancy of each succeeding writer had
abundant scope in endeavouring to fit, and to persuade others
that he had fitted, plants of Northern Europe to accounts
written in the Mediterranean region’ 12. Jackson does not
mention Dioscorides' profound historical influence. 
For fifteen hundred years  De Materia Medica was
widely read and reproduced as copies, translations,
excerpts, and paraphrases in Arabic, Greek and Latin.
Claus Nissen in Herbals of five centuries , L’Art Ancien,
Zurich 1958 is more generous:  ‘It owes its universal
acceptance to the exemplary accuracy and scientific
scrupulousness with which all available data concerning the
appearance and occurrence of drugs, their preparation,
preservation, indication, and dosage have been collected and
discussed, as well as to its comprehensiveness which takes
account of all remedies, from the three kingdoms of nature, that

were then known thoughout the Mediterranean region’ 13.
Furthermore he says,  ‘There is no doubt that, besides
chemistry, pharmacognosy and, especially, pharmacobotanics
constitute a glorious chapter in the history of Islamic learning,
for the ancient legacy in this field was not only preserved but
independently augmented and developed. It was particularly
Dioskorides’ Materia Medica which enjoyed such high esteem
that it was likened to the Koran in a manner almost
blasphemous to Muslim eyes’14. It was the final authority on
pharmacy in Turkey and Spain until the nineteenth
century. 
In the first half of the twelfth century Matthaeus
Platearius of the medical school at Salerno wrote Circa
Instans, an alphabetic listing and textbook of simples
based on Dioscorides Vulgaris, containing the appearance,
manufacture, and applications of drugs. It achieved wide
recognition, being among the first herbals printed in
1488. Ernst Meyer 15 placed it on a par with Pliny and
Dioscorides, while George Sarton 16 saw it as a great
improvement over De Materia Medica  and other herbal
writings.
De Materia Medica  impeded botanical thought,
although not for its contents —  doctrinaire usage stifled
continuing investigation. Dioscorides cannot be
considered an original thinker, nor did he engage in
primary research. His work is a compendium of known
medicinal plants of the Roman Empire, with some new
introductions, and certain misidentifications. Many of his 
plant names are still in use, although not necessarily for
the same plants, as we show in this new volume. His
descriptions were sometimes brief, often accurate,
including distribution and other information. We may
regard him as a founder of botanical science. Thomas
Johnson, an outstanding figure among British
herbalist/botanists of the sixteenth century, friend and
close collaborator of John Goodyer, considered De
Materia Medica  the foundation and basis of all that
followed in the field. The Rinascimento, or Rennaissance,

revived interest in knowledge and learning, first in Italy
in the mid-fifteenth century, spreading northwards some 
five decades later. Many botanists and herbalists of the
sixteenth century based their texts on those of the ancient 
Greeks, often referring to Pedanios Dioscorides.
His medicinal plants formed the basis of modern
botany, establishing the link between botany and
medicine, and giving rise to the herbal as we know it; to
physic gardens; to the careers of men such as Linnaeus;
and latterly, to ethnobotany. It was the medieval
physician's duty to fear God and know his Dioscorides,
and modern pharmacology stems from his attempts to
systematize medicinal knowledge. We even owe the
term 'botany' to Dioscorides, who used the Greek term
botane, meaning herb. The most influential English
herbal, Gerard’s The Herball or generall historie of plantes,
frequently mentions Dioscorides, and the introduction
‘To the … Readers’ states ‘From whence there spring floures
not onely to adorne the garlands of the Muses, … but also such
fruit as learned Dioscorides long travelled for’ 17. The
illustrated title page of the Herball’s second edition in 1633 
shows Dioscorides and Theophrastus as the pillars of
healing knowledge. This iconic tradition continues on
the title pages of Charles de L’Ecluse’s  Rariorum
Plantarum Historia  of 1601, and his  Curae posteriores  of
1611; Rembert Dodoens’ Stirpium Historiae Pemptades Sex
of 1616; Jean Bauhin and Jean Henri Cherlier’s  Historia
Plantarum Universalis  of 1650-1651;  and Giorgio Dalla
Torre’s Dryandum, Amadryandum Cloridisque Triumphus of 
1685; as well as the document dated 1 July 1737 in which
the Royal College of Surgeons commended Elizabeth
Blackwell’s A curious herbal.
Two and a half centuries before Sibthorp, Dr Johann
von Cube, a German physician, travelled to the East to
find the plants of Dioscorides and other masters. In 1485
he published Hortus Sanitatus, one of the earliest printed
herbals. Valerius Cordus (1515 to 1544) travelled through
Italy and Germany seeking plants in their natural habitat
that the Classical authors, particularly Dioscorides, had
described. Cordus lectured on plants at the University of
Wittenberg; Adnotationes ad Dioscorides was published
 xxxvi

from student notes some years after his early death.
Cordus' careful observations provided accurate plant
descriptions. The scientist Luigi Anguillara (1512 to 1570)
travelled through Italy, Greece, the Balkans, and Central
Europe on a similar quest. A professor at the University of 
Padua, he became director of its botanic garden, the first
in the world. Similarly, Leonhardt Rauwolf, who died in
1596, travelled from Augsburg to the Levant ‘ chiefly to
gain a clear and distinct knowledge of those delicate herbs
described by Theophrastus, Dioscorides, Avicenna et al, by
viewing them in their proper and native places and to encourage 
the apothecaries to procure the right sorts for their shops’ 18.
Before Gerard's time, William Turner, an influential
English theologian and physician, published his herbals
in 1538 and 1548, and wrote of his famous botany teacher
Luca Ghini of Bologna, ‘Lucas Gynus the reader of
Dioscorides in bonomy, my maister ’19. Ghini lectured on
Dioscorides for twenty-eight years. Joseph Pitton de
Tournefort (1656 to 1708), a Frenchman, and one of the
earliest systematic (classification) botanists, identified
many of Dioscorides’ plants during travels in Asia Minor.
Frans A Stafleu20 commented that Carl Linnaeus, ‘the
Prince of botanists’ 21, was the object of an hero-worship
previously unknown in botany, with the possible
exception of Dioscorides. In Linnaeus' concise history of
botany, Bibliotheca botanica 22, he names Theophrastus,
Pliny and Dioscorides among outstanding phytologists
of all ages, with no others until the fifteenth century. The
famous Dutch botanist Johannes Burman (1707 to 1779)
was internationally so highly regarded he received the
cognomen Dioscorides III from the Leopoldina, the German 
academy of sciences. In 1703 Charles Plumier dedicated
the edible yam genus with its six hundred species to
Dioscorides, naming it dioscorea. A fitting tribute, since a
number of dioscorea species yield diosgenin, a precursor
of progesterone, valuable for modern drugs such as oral
contraceptives and cortisone.
Sir Arthur Hill, Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens
at Kew, described a visit to Mount Athos in 1934: ‘ The

official botanist monk ... was a remarkable old man with an
extensive knowledge of plants and their properties ... he
travelled very quickly, usually on foot, and sometimes on a
mule, carrying his flora with him in a large black bulky bag ...
his flora was nothing less than four manuscript volumes of
Dioscorides, which apparently he himself had copied out. This
flora he invariably used for determining any plant which he
could not name at sight, and he could find his way in his books
— and identify his plants to his own satisfaction — with
remarkable rapidity’ 23. This indicates the powerful
influence of De Materia Medica up to the twentieth
century.
The great American botanical historian Edward Lee
Greene in Landmarks of Botanical History offers a fitting
tribute to Dioscorides: ‘If to have written the most practically
serviceable book of botany that the world of learning knew of
during sixteen centuries were the best title to botanical
greatness, to Dioscorides would readily be conceded the absolute 
supremacy over all other botanists, not only of antiquity but of
all time’24.
In Historia rei herbariae,  1807-1808, volume 1, Kurt
Polycarp Joachim Sprengel wrote: ‘ During more than
sixteen centuries, he was looked up to as the sole authority, so
that everything botanical began with him. Everyone who
undertook the study of botany or the identification of medicines
swore by his words. Even as late as the beginning of the
seventeenth century both the academic and the private study of
botany may almost be said to have begun and ended with the
text of Dioscorides’25. 
History remains the arbiter of the duration and value
of Dioscorides' work.

THE BOTANICAL
ILLUSTRATIONS
This version of Dioscorides is richly illustrated with
pictures of plants and natural history objects,
primarily woodcuts from the 16th and 19th centuries,
and copper engravings or lithographs from the 19th
century. We know very little of the artists who made the
illustrations reproduced here. For example, in Engler's
voluminous writings most paintings by Joseph Pohl are
unsigned, thus preventing accurate attribution. Some
information about the artists represented herein, with
the context in which they worked, is given below.
MATERIALS & METHODS
Multiple images for early printed books were
woodcuts, a relief process, usually a black line drawing of
the original picture on a wood block, the unwanted
background between the drawn lines was cut away with
a sharp knife to prevent contact with the ink roller. The
design is in relief, the printer’s ink is deposited on the
raised surface, and transferred by pressure onto paper.
The image is drawn in reverse as with most forms of
printing. In wood engraving, a refinement of the
woodcut,  the engraver uses a burin, a fine steel cutting
tool, obtaining a multitude of fine lines to give subtle
gradations simulating grey tones. The crafter usually cuts 
on the end grain of hard woods to permit a
predominance of white lines. Lithography is a
planographic or surface process utilising drawing upon
stone. The drawing is made with greasy ink or chalk on a
particular kind of limestone, porous to both grease and
water. Once the drawing is ‘fixed’, the stone is damped
with water and an ink roller passed over it. This ‘inks’ the
stone wherever the drawing has been made and leaves
no mark on the rest of the stone. Paper is now passed
over the stone through a scraper press. Lithography
permits subtle gradations of tone, speedily and
economically. Other printing techniques traditionally
used for botanical illustrations include intaglio printing

— such as copper engraving, mezzotint, stipple
engraving, aquatint, and soft ground etching — full or
partial colour printing, chromolithography, and a variety

using photographic, electronic, and digital processes
offer further possibilities.
THE ILLUSTRATORS
Botanical illustrators originally documented plants
for medicinal purposes. These early scientific drawings of 
plants assisted the searcher after simples ie. species of
herbs. Illustrations in the magnificent sixth-century
manuscript herbal Codex Vindobonensis 26 exhibit a
standard of excellence unusual in its day, and not
exceeded for nearly a millenium. During this 'dreary'
millenium most manuscripts were not illustrated, or
included pen drawings copied repeatedly by scribes with 
no artistic skills. Early printed herbals copied these
indifferent plant outlines. 
Realistic plant drawings appeared towards the end of
the fourteenth century, Albrecht Durer and Leonardo da
Vinci being the best-known artists. Herbarius zu Teutsch
(the German Herbarius) 1485 was the first printed herbal
with plant drawings showing greater freedom and
realism. Next in significance is Otto Brunfels' Herbarum
vivae eicones  (living portraits of plants), 3 volumes
1530-1536, with illustrations by Hans Weiditz (1488 to
1534) a pupil of Albrecht Durer — the drawings
transferred to woodcuts by excellent engravers. Brunfels
paid tribute to the artist at the beginning of the first
volume, but dismissed the illustrations as dead lines
inferior to his own truthful text descriptions. Weiditz
drew actual plants with scientific correctness, including
blemishes and deformities in great detail. The figures
seem drawn in pen, with fine, deep strokes. According to
Wilfred Blunt ‘ His work must ever remain the high-water
mark of woodcutting employed in the service of botanical
illustration’27. From 1522 Strassburg publishers Schott,
Knoblauch, Kopfel and Beck used professional

illustrators, including Weiditz, mainly for botanical and
zoological works. Weiditz' skills were in great demand,
illustrating numerous books including Albertus Magnus,
Wunderbar naturliche wirckungen  1531, and Konrad von
Megenberg’s Puch der Natur 1536. These plates were
pirated by Frankfurt publisher Christian Egenolph for
herbals edited by Eucharius d J Rossllin (and later
Theodoric Dorsten), and published as Kreutterbuch 1533
with later editions, titles and translations. From 1562
copies of these woodcuts appeared in the journal
published by Egenolph, Plantarum arborum fruticum et
herbarum effigies . Some four hundred years after they
were drawn, about seventy original pen drawings by
Weiditz, painted in watercolours, were discovered in the
herbarium of Felix Platter in Berne. It was noted that the
woodcuts' variable lines reflected the nervous energy of
Weiditz’s artistry, and that the engraver of the
woodblocks had taken some liberties in copying, mainly
to fit larger drawings on to the printed page, and deleting 
details of flowers and seeds.
Soon thereafter Leonhart Fuchs (1501 to 1566)
published De historia stirpium 1542, a splendid folio
volume, the illustrations of far greater value than the text. 
Unusually, credit is given to the artists — Albrecht Meyer
who drew the plants according to Fuchs' rigorous
instructions, Heinrich Fullmaurer who transferred the
drawings to wood blocks, and Veit Rudolf Speckle who
cut the wood blocks. The plates dazzle with crisp, white
paper, fine printing and layout, and elegant designs.
With hundreds of full-page illustrations of plants, it is the
earliest monumental flower-book. In the preface Fuchs
writes about the illustrations: ‘As far as concerns the pictures 
themselves, each of which is positively delineated according to
the features and likeness of the living plants, we have taken
peculiar care that they should be most perfect, and, moreover, we 
have devoted the greatest diligence to secure that every plant
should be depicted with its own roots, stalks, leaves, flowers,
seeds and fruits. … and we have not allowed the craftsmen so to
indulge their whims as to cause the drawings not to correspond
accurately to the truth’28. Speckle, ‘by far the best engraver of

THE BOTANICAL ILLUSTRATIONS

Plants, an analytical history of botanical illustration', Zwemmer in association with the
Victoria and Albert Museum, 1995, London.

Strasbourg’29, had a line often rigid and wiry, suitable for
subsequent watercolour wash. Fuchs’ artists idealized
the plants, showing flowering and fruiting stages
simultaneously, with  life-sized plants including roots
when possible, but with less detail, achieving unmatched
clarity of line reproduction. The plates were copied or
adapted by many later herbal writers including John
Gerard, Tabernaemontanus, Dodoens, Bock, Turner,
Lyte and Schinz, to the chagrin of Fuchs who saw his fine
work used without acknowledgement, and mostly as
inferior copies. Many scholars consider these the finest
botanical woodcuts, though some prefer the sharp
figures of Weiditz. Meyer's flowers are delicate, Weiditz'
are bold; Meyer had a clinical perception, Weiditz
approached individual plants with appreciation; Meyer
was limited by Fuchs' insistence on precision without
artistic expression and feeling. Perhaps that is why his
illustrations were used for more than 200 years.
Although not new, copperplate etching was only
employed for botanical illustration towards the end of
the sixteenth century. Eventually this and other
techniques replaced the use of woodblocks. However,
wood-engraving flourished again for a while in the
nineteenth century. Thomas Bewick (1753 to 1828) led
this revival, using skills learnt as a copper engraver. He
substituted hard boxwood for soft wood, engraving on
the end grain of the wood. Perfecting this technique
enabled the use of wood engraving for detailed
illustrations, often made from photographs. Examples
are found in Baillon’s Histoire des plantes  1866-1895, and
Anton Kerner von Marilaun’s Pflanzenleben 1887-1891.
Pflanzenleben contained some of the last of the fine
woodcuts in botanical illustration. Continental engravers 
were as skilful as the British. The technical brilliance of
these later wood engravings restored the technique to
the status of an art, thus it avoided competing with
photographic tone reproduction.
The Frenchman, Auguste Faguet (1841 to 1886), a
prolific illustrator of the late nineteenth century,
produced delicate botanical wood engravings of great
accuracy. These drawings indicate true perspective,  the

careful craftsmanship making distant elements recede.
He illustrated the extensive set of Henri Ernest Baillon’s
Histoire des plantes 1866-1895, including its many editions.  
Faguet's other work for Baillon included Recherches … des
coniferes 1860; Dictionnaire de botanique 1876-1892; 1186
woodcuts in Traite de botanique medicale phanerogamique
1883-1884; 370 woodcuts in Traite de botanique medicale
cryptogamique 1889; Loganiacees 1856; and Bignoniacees
1864. Henri Faguet’s talent also benefited Edouard
Bureau's Monographie des bignoniacee  1864; Alfred
Grandidier's monumental Histoire physique, naturelle et
politique de Madagascar  1875; and Histoire naturelle des
plantes 1886-1903. Among other artists Faguet also
worked on a periodical, L’Horticulteur Francais, journal des
amateurs et des interets horticoles 1851-1872. These fine
woodcuts were superseded by renewed general use of
metal printing plates for botanical illustrations.  
Thiebault assisted Faguet in illustrating Henri
Baillon’s Histoire des plantes  1866-1895. He also
contributed engraved text figures to Dujardin-Beaumetz
& Egasse’s Les plantes medicinales indigenes ex exotique 1889, 
and his drawings appeared in The Floral Register , a
periodical published from 1825 to 1851. 
In Pflanzenleben 1887-1891 Anton Joseph Ritter Kerner
von Marilaun (1831 to 1898)  used a number of Austrian
and German artists, their work interpreted as
wood-engravings. This important two-volume work
spawned several editions, including translations into
English, Russian, Italian and Dutch. We know little of
these artists, among whom are Adele von Kerner, Ernst
Heyn (1841 to 1894), F Tegetmeyer, Hermann von
Konigsbrunn (1823 to 1907), Eugen von Ransonnet (1838 
to ? ), Ignaz Seelos (1827 to 1902), Joseph Selleny (1824 to
1875), K Springer, S Teuchmann, and Olof Winkler (1843
to 1895). Olof Winkler and Ernst Heyn assisted with the
preparation of lithographs from illustrations (and
chromolithographs from  paintings) by Joseph Selleny
and others . Anton Kerner von Marilaun illustrated his
own Monographia Pulmoniarum  1878. Ernst Heyn
illustrated Emil Adolf Rossmassler’s Der Wald  1863,
producing 117 copper engravings. Hermann von
Konigsbrunn illustrated Franz Xaver Unger’s
Wissenschaftliche ergebnisse einer reise in Griechenland 1862.

THE BOTANICAL ILLUSTRATIONS

Maximilianae 1879. German professor  Heinrich Moritz
Willkomm (1821 to 1895), specialised in the botany of
south-western Europe. He often illustrated his own
works, and his coloured drawings are mainly of unusual
plants from Spain, Portugal, and the Balearic Islands. His
many publications include Recherches sur … Globulariees
1850; Icones et descriptiones plantarum novarum  1852-1862;
as well as Illustrationes florae Hispaniae 1881-1892 with
coloured lithograph plates. AH Payne and A Eckstein
occasionally provided him with illustrations.
The well-travelled Otto Warburg (1859 to 1938) ,
botanist and political activist, produced the richly
illustrated Die pflanzenwelt 1913-1922, with figures by H
Buffe, H Eichhorn, M Gurke, U Grimme amongst others,
including some coloured plates. Warburg's extensive
work emerged from his travels in south-eastern Asia,
Oceania, Australia and southern Africa.
Heinrich Gustaf Adolf Engler (1844 to 1930) was the
most prolific German botanical taxonomist. He published 
ambitiously and enthusiastically, using a number of
artists to illustrate his works, including Joseph Pohl, an
artist with apprenticeship as a wood-engraver. Engler
noticed Pohl's talent very early, starting a collaboration of 
almost forty years. Amongst his prodigious output Josef
Pohl (1864 to 1939) drew over 33,000 items in 6,000 figures 
for Engler’s Die naturlichen pflanzenfamilien 1887-1914. His
plants are finely and accurately executed, but without
flair. This work is of particular value because many new
plants were described for the first time. The drawings are
plain but complement the lengthy Latin descriptions in
this monumental production. The illustrations take on
particular significance because many of the actual plants,
delineated so carefully, were destroyed in the bombing of 
the Berlin Herbarium. Pohl illustrated other major works
by Engler, including  Das pflanzenreich 1900-1953; Die
pflanzenwelt Afrikas 1908-1910; Monographien afrikanischer
pflanzenfamilien 1898-1904; and most of the illustrations
for the periodical Engler’s Botanische jahrbucher 1881 et seq.
Assisted by Gottfried Keller (1873 to 1945) and Karoly
Rezso Soo von Bere (1903 to 1980), Pohl illustrated
Friedrich Richard Rudolf Schlechter’s Monographie und
iconographie der orchideen 1928-1942; and Karl Moritz
Schumann’s Bluhende kakteen  ( Iconographia cactacearum )

1900-1921; and was one of many artists contributing (i.e.
the orchid illustrations) to Carl Friedrich Philipp von
Martius' magnificent Flora Brasiliensis 1840-1906.
Vogelmeyer and Henri Bocquillon also contributed some
drawings to Engler’s publications.
Jean Emmanuel Maurice le Maout illustrated his Atlas
elementaire de botanique 1846; as well as Lecons elementaire
de botanique 1844, including later editions. With Joseph
Decaisne he wrote Flore elementaire des jardins et des champs 
1855, translated by Mrs Hooker as General system of botany
1876. With P Bernard and L Couilhac, Maout's first book
was published as Le jardin des plantes 1842-1843.
Botanical art highlights two opposing needs —
revealing the true physical character of a plant; and the
illustrator's response to the beauty of the subject. Each
artist balances the conflict of art versus science. Most
botanical publications require large numbers of
illustrations, demanding speed as well as accuracy, and a
working knowledge of current printing technology. The
illustrations selected for this volume appeal both
scientifically and descriptively, while incorporating a
decidedly decorative quality. They also had to survive
the transition to digital format.

Arum maculatum
from BRUNFELS — 1530

 BOOK ONE: AROMATICS
1-1. IRIS
SUGGESTED: Iris germanica [Fuchs, Brunfels, Linnaeus]
Iris vulgaris Germanica sive sylvestris [Bauhin] 
— German Iris, Blue Flower de Luce, Flowering Ring
PROFESSIONAL USE ONLY
Iris is named because of its resemblance to the rainbow
in heaven. It bears leaves like little daggers but bigger,
broader and fatter [or thicker]: the flowers on the stalk
are bent in one over against another and have varied
colours for they are white, pale, black, purple or azure
[blue]. It is because of the variety of colours that it is
compared to the heavenly rainbow. The roots
underneath are knotty and strong [or sound] with a
sweet taste. These when cut should be dried in the shade
and stored with a linen thread put through them. The
best is from Illyria and Macedonia and the best of these
has a thick stumpy root, hard to break, of a faint yellow
colour with an especially good scent and very bitter to the 
taste. It has a sound smell and does not incline to
nastiness or cause sneezing when pounded. The second
is from Libya. It is white in colour, bitter to the taste, next
in strength (to the former), and when these grow old they 
are worm-eaten yet then they smell even sweeter. 
They are all warming and reduce the intensity of
symptoms. They are suitable against coughs and reduce
the intensity of thick mucus that is hard to get up. Seven
teaspoonfuls of a decoction (taken as a drink in honey
water) purge thick mucus and bile. They also cause sleep,
provoke tears, and heal suffering in the bowels. Taken as
a drink with vinegar they help those bitten by venomous
creatures, the splenetic, those troubled with convulsive
fits or chilled and stiff with cold, and those who drop
their food. Taken in a drink with wine they bring out the
menstrual flow. A decoction of them is suitable for
women’s warm packs that soften and open their private
places; for sciatica (taken as an infusion); for fistulas, and
all sores and wounds that it fills up with flesh. Applied as
an eye salve with honey they draw out particles. Chewed
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

and applied as a poultice they soften swellings and old
hard swellings, and dried they fill up ulcers and clean
them. With honey they fill up bare bones with flesh. They 
are good for headaches applied as a poultice with vinegar 
and rosaceum [1-53]. Daubed on with white hellebore and
twice as much honey they clean off freckles and sunburn. 
They are also mixed with suppositories, warm
compresses and fatigue removers, and in general they are 
of considerable use. This is also called iris illyrica, thelpida,
urania, catharon, or thaumastos; the Romans call it radix
marica, some, gladiolus, others, opertritis or consecratrix,
and the Egyptians call it nar.
1-2. AKORON
SUGGESTED: Acorum officinarum, Gladiolus luteus [Fuchs,
Brunfels], Acorus adulterinus [Bauhin], Iris pseudacorus
[Linnaeus] — Yellow Flag, Water Flag
[other usage] Acorus calamus, Acorus aromaticus,
 Acorus odoratus — Sweet Flag, Sweet Sedge, Myrtle Sedge 
see 1-17, 1-114 — calamus
Acorum has leaves which resemble those of iris very
much only narrower, and the roots are similar only
one wrapped in the other, not growing downward but
sidelong in the upper part of the earth. They are sharp to
the taste, distinguished by pale white knots, and not
unpleasant to smell. The best is thick and white, not
worm-eaten, full and fragrant. Root such as this comes
from Colchis and from Galatia and is called asplenium. 
The root is heating and a decoction of it (taken as a
drink) causes an urge to urinate. It is good for pain of the
rectum, chest and liver; and for griping, hernia and
convulsions. It reduces the spleen, and it helps those sick
with dripping mucus, and those poisoned by animal
bites. It is effective in a hip bath like iris for female
problems. The juice of the root cleans off things that
darken the pupils of the eyes. The root of it is also
effective mixed with antidotes. It is also called chorus,
aphrodisia or the mariner’s root; the Romans call it venerea,
and the Gauls call it the pepper of bees, piper apum.

SUGGESTED: Daucus creticus, Tordylon, Seseli creticum [Fuchs],
Athemanta meum [Linnaeus], Aethusa meum,
  Meum athemanticum [in Sprague], Athemanticum meum,
 Seseli meum — Bald-money, Meu, Spignel, Bear Root 
see 3-63
The meum which is called athamanticum grows
abundantly in Macedonia and Spain, and is similar in 
the stalk and leaves to anethum [3-67], but thicker than
anethum, sometimes rising up to two feet, scattered
underneath with thin, winding, straight, long roots,
smelling sweet and warming the tongue. The roots
(boiled with water or pounded smooth [or fine] without
boiling and taken in a drink) lessen pains caused by
obstructions around the bladder and kidneys. They are
good for urinary difficulties, a gas-filled stomach,
griping, diseases of the womb and pain in the joints.
Pounded into small pieces with honey and taken as
syrup they help a rheumatic chest; boiled for a hip bath
they draw out the blood of the menstrual flow. Applied
as a plaster to the lower part of children’s bellies they
induce the movement of urine. If more of a decoction
than is suitable is taken as a drink it causes a headache. 
1-4. KUPEIROS
SUGGESTED: Cyperus [Fuchs], Cyperus odoratus radice longa,
Cyperus officinarum [Bauhin], Cyperus longus [Linnaeus]
  Cyperus esculentis, Cyperus officinalis, Cyperus olivaris,
 Cyperus radicosus, Cyperus hydra — Yellow Nutsedge,
Earth Almond, Edible Cyperus, Rush Nut 
Cyperus has leaves like porrum [2-179] but longer and
more slender; and a stalk of a foot high or higher
with corners like juncus odoratus [4-52, 1-16] on the top of
which there emerge little leaves and seed. Use has been
made of the roots of this for as long as the use of the olive.
They lie underneath, adhering together — round, black,
smelling good, bitter. It grows in clay or shale places as
well as marshy. The best is heaviest — thick, full, hard to
break, rough with a particular sharpness, such as the
Silician and Syrian, and that from the Cycladean Islands.
 5
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

It is warming, dilates the narrow openings of blood
vessels and is diuretic. A decoction (taken as a drink)
helps those troubled with stones [urinary, kidney] and
dropsy and also those bitten by scorpions. Applied as a
warm pack it is good for chills of the vulva and its
obstruction, drawing down the menstrual flow. Dried
and pounded to powder it is good for an ulcerous mouth, 
even though the ulcers are erosive. It is mixed with warm
compresses for heating, and is effective for thickening
ointments. Some speak also of another kind of cyperus,
like ginger, which grows in India, which when chewed is
found to taste bitter like saffron. Applied as an ointment it 
presently removes hair [ depilatory]. The Romans call it
the root of the bulrush, others the bulrush. Some call
cyperus, as well as aspalathus [1-19], by the name of
erysisceptrum. 
1-5. KARDAMOMON
SUGGESTED: Amomum cardamom —  Cardamom
see 1-14
The best cardamomum is brought out of Comagene,
Armenia and Bosporus. It grows too in India and
Arabia. Choose that which is hard to break, full, tightly
shut (for that which is not is out of date), and which also
has an offensive smell, and is sharp to the taste and
somewhat bitter. 
A decoction (taken as a drink with water) is able to
heat. It is good for those who have illness comitralis
[possibly from comites — veins, arteries adjacent to nerves 
— mitralism — lesions on the heart], coughs, sciatica,
paralysis, hernias, convulsions and griping, and it expels
rectal worms. Taken as a drink with wine it is good for
those who have defective kidneys and difficulty meiendi
[urination]. It is also good for one who has been stricken
by a scorpion and for all those hurt by the venom of other
creatures. A teaspoonful (taken as a drink with bark from
the roots of bay) breaks stones [kidney, urinary]. Taken as 
inhalations of smoke or fumes it is an abortifacient, and
daubed on with vinegar it takes away parasitic skin
diseases. It is also mixed in thick ointments and other
antidotes.

Phu vulgare
after FUCHS — 1545

1-6. NARDOS
SUGGESTED: Phu germanicum, Valeriana vulgaris, 
Phu vulgare [Fuchs], Valeriana sylvestris major [Bauhin],
Valeriana officinalis [Linnaeus] — Valerian [Mabberley]
Jatamansi, Nardostachys jatamansi, Valeriana spica, 
Valeriana jatamansi — Nardus, Spikenard, Indian Valerian,
Nard 
There are two kinds of nardus. The one is called Indian, 
the other Syrian. Not that it is found in Syria, but
because one part of the mountain where it grows turns
towards Syria and the other towards India. Of that which 
is called Syrian the best is new, smooth, full of filaments, a 
yellow colour, very fragrant, and resembles cyprus [1-124] 
in the smell. It has a short ear, a bitter taste, and is very
drying to the tongue, its sweet smell lasting a long time.
Of the Indian, one kind is called Gangetic from a certain
river named Ganges running by the hill where it grows. It 
is somewhat weaker in strength because it comes out of
watery places. It is higher and has more ears coming out
of the same root, both full of filaments, and one wrapped
in the other, with a poisonous smell. That which grows
more on the hill is a great deal sweeter, short-eared,
resembling cyprus [1-124] in the sweetness of its smell,
and having other qualities in it, like that which is
surnamed the Syrian nardus. There is also another kind of 
nardus called Sampharitic from the name of the place —
very little, yet great-eared, with a white stalk sometimes
growing in the middle, very much like the smell of a goat
in scent. This ought utterly to be refused. It is also sold
infused which fault is found out as follows: that the ear of
it is white, withered, and with down on it. They
adulterate it by blowing stibium [trisulphide of antimony
or black antimony] with water or date wine into it to
make it denser, and so that it may be heavier. 
When you are to use it, if any dirt sticks to the roots of
it you are to take it off and sift it, separating the dust,
which is good to make washing water for the hands. The
roots are warming, drying and uretic, as a result (taken as
a drink) they stop the bowels. Applied they stop
discharges of the womb and the whites [ leucorrhoea, a
mucosal vaginal discharge]. A decoction (taken as a drink 
with cold water) helps nausea and stomach rosiones

Valeriana officinalis
after THIEBAULT — 1881

[gnawing corrosion], those troubled with wind, sickness
of the liver or head, and painful kidneys. Boiled in water
and given either as a warm pack or hip bath they heal
inflammation of the vulva. They are good for superfluous 
fluids of the eyelids, drying and thickening them. For
moist bodies a sprinkling is effective to take away the
smell of sweat. They are mixed with antidotes. Ground
smooth and made into balls with wine, they are stored for 
eye medicines in a new jar, which has not been smeared
with pitch.
1-7. NARDOS KELTIKE
SUGGESTED: Valeriana celticus, Nardus celticus
— Celtic Spikenard, Celtic Valerian 
The Celtic nard grows on the Alps of Liguria in that
country called Gallica. It also grows in Istria. It is a
little short shrub that is gathered together with the roots
and made up into hand bundles. It has somewhat long
leaves of a pale yellow with a yellow flower. Use is only
made of the stalks and roots and the sweet smell is only
from them. As a result (having the day before sprinkled
the bindings with water and taken off the earthy stuff),
you ought to lay them in a more moist ground (having
first laid paper under them), and the next day you ought
to make them clean again, together with the chaff and
strange stuff, for that which is good in it is not taken away 
by the strength of the moisture. This herb is often
counterfeited by another herb like it gathered together
with it which because of the poisonous smell that it has
they call the goat, but the difference is easily known for
this herb is without a stalk, whiter, and with shorter
leaves, neither has it a bitter or sweet-smelling root as in
the true nardus.
Choose the little stalks and the roots but throw away
the leaves. If you will put them in storage you must first
have them ground smooth and mixed with wine. Then
make them into little balls and keep them in new ceramic
bottles, corking them carefully. The best is new, fragrant,
full of roots, plump and not easily broken. It is good for
the same things as the Syrian but it is more diuretic and
better for stomach disorders. Taken as a drink with a
decoction of wormwood [3-26] it helps inflammation of

the liver, jaundice, and gas-filled intestines. In the same
way it is good for the spleen, bladder and kidneys, as well 
as mixed with wine for bites of venomous creatures. It is
used in warm compresses, liquid medicines and
warming ointments. 
1-8. NARDOS OREINE
SUGGESTED: Valeriana dioica — Marsh Valerian
Mountain nardus (which is called thylacitis and nevis
by some) grows in Cilicia and Syria. It has stalks
and leaves like eryngium but smaller, yet not sharp and
prickly. The two or more roots that lie underneath are
black and fragrant like asphodelus, but thinner and a great
deal smaller. It does not have a stalk, fruit or flower for
any long time. The root is good for the same things as the
Celtic nardus [1-7].
1-9. ASARON
SUGGESTED: Asarum europaeum — Asarabacca, Cabaret,
 Wild Nard, Hazelwort 
POISONOUS
Asarum has leaves like cissus but much thicker and
rounder, with a flower between the leaves near the
root that is an azure [blue] colour like cytinus [1-127] or
hyoscyamus [4-69], in which lies seed like the kernels of
grapes. The many roots underneath smell like cinnamon.
It loves rough, dry ground. The root of this helps hernia,
convulsions, old coughs, difficulty in breathing, and
difficulty in urinating. It expels the menstrual flow, and
taken as a drink with wine it is good for those poisoned
by animal bites. The leaves are astringent, and are
applied to help inflammation, pains in the head, new
ulcers of the eyes, breasts inflamed after childbearing and 
erysipela [inflammatory skin disease]. The smell induces
sleep. Crateuas the herbalist concurs. Many roots lie
underneath — knotty, slender and crooked like grasses,
yet a great deal slenderer and smelling good, heating,
and biting the tongue considerably. They are diuretic and 
warming. They cause vomiting and are good for dropsy
 13
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

and obstinate ischuria [ hip pains? — urine retention?],
and they bring down the menstrual flow. Six
teaspoonfuls of the roots (taken as a drink with honey
and water) purge like white hellebore. They are mixed
with ointments. It grows on shady mountains and is
common in Pontus, Phrygia, Illyricum and Vestinum,
Italy. It is also called nardus sylvestris , the Magi call it
sanguis martis, the Osthenes, thesa, the Egyptians, cereera,
the Romans, perpensa. It is also called baccharis, the
Thuscans (or Etruscans) call it succinum, some call it
nardus rustica, and the Gauls call it baccar.
1-10. PHOU
SUGGESTED: Phu magnum, Valeriana maior, Phu verum [Fuchs]
Valeriana hortensis [Bauhin] Valeriana phu [Linnaeus],
Valeriana dioscorides — Phu, Cretan Spikenard,
Garden Valerian
Phu (which some also call sylvestris nardus  [garden
nard]) grows in Pontus, and it has leaves much like
elaphoboscon [2-182] or hipposelinon [3-78], with a stalk of a
foot high or more — smooth, soft, inclining to a purple
colour, hollow in the middle and distinguished by knots.
The lower parts are somewhat like those of narcissus but
bigger, more tender and purple in a pale white. The root
in its upper part is about the thickness of the little finger,
and it has filaments like juncus odoratus [4-52, 1-16] or
veratrum nigrum [4-151] that grow within one another — a 
pale yellow, pleasantly-scented and resembling nardus in
its smell, with a certain poisonous kind of heaviness.
Dried and given in drinks it is warming and encourages
urine, and a decoction of it may do the same. It is good for 
a painful rectum, encourages the menstrual flow, and is
mixed with antidotes. It is adulterated mixed with the
roots of ruscus [4-146] but the knowledge of this is easy —
for these are hard, not easily broken and without any
good smell.

1-11. MALABATHRON
SUGGESTED: Trapa bicornis — Ling Nut
Trapa bispinosa — Singhara Nut 
Trapa quadrispinosa — Water Chestnut sp
Limnantheum indicum, Nymphoides indica — Water Snowflake
Some imagine malabathrum to be the leaf of the Indian
nardus [1-6] (deceived by the similarity of the smell)
for there are many things like nardus in smell, such as phu
[1-10], asarum and neris [?4-82]. But this is not so for it is a
particular herb that grows in the Indian marshes with the 
leaves swimming on the water like the palustris lens [4-88]
in the marshes, with no root. Having gathered it they
immediately pierce it through with a linen thread, drying 
it like this, and preserve it. They say that when the
summer heat dries up the water, the earth is burnt along
with the shoots of it, and unless this happens it will
spring up no more.  The best is new and a pale white
inclining to blackness, hard to break, sound, biting the
nose with its smell, and the sweetness of its smell is long-
lasting. It is like nardus [1-6] in taste without any taste of
salt. That which is weak with a mouldy scent and breaks
into small pieces is worthless. It has the same properties
as nardus but does everything more forcibly. Malabathrum
is more diuretic and better for the stomach. It helps
inflammation of the eyes pounded into small pieces,
boiled in wine, and rubbed on. It is put under the tongue
for sweetness of the breath, and it is put among cloths for
it keeps them from moths and scents them sweetly.
1-12. KASSIA
SUGGESTED: Cassia acutifolia — True Senna,
 Alexandrian Senna  
Cassia fistula — Purging Cassia, Golden Shower, 
Indian Laburnum
Cassia angustifolia — Indian Senna 
There are many kinds of cassia growing around Arabia 
with stores of aromatic things. It has a twig with a
thick bark and leaves like pepper. Choose that which is
reddish-yellow, with a good colour, resembling coral —
very slender, long and thick, full of tubes, with a biting
 17
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

taste, and astringent with considerable heat, aromatic,
and resembling wine in its smell. Such, by the inhabitants 
of the country, is called achy, and the merchants in
Alexandria call it daphnitis Above this is preferred the
black kind which is called gizir, inclining to a purple and
thick, with a smell like a rose, the most suitable of any for
bodily uses; and that formerly spoken of is next to this.
The third kind is called mosyleticus blastos. The rest are of
no account such as that which is called aphysemon — black 
and unsightly and thinly- barked or having it full of
chinks — as well as that which is called  kitto and dacar.
There is also a certain bastard cassia, amazingly similar,
which is found out by its taste that is neither sharp nor
aromatic, and it has bark adhering to the soft internal
tissue. There is also found a broad reed — tender, light,
full of branches — which is better than the others. Reject
that which is a pale white, coarse, smells like a goat, and
has not a thick reed but is coarse and thin.  It is diuretic,
warming, drying and gently astringent. It is fit for eye
medicines that are made for clearing the sight, and for
warm compresses. It takes away freckles applied with
honey, and encourages the menstrual flow. Taken as a
drink it helps those bitten by snakes. It is good too taken
as a drink for all internal inflammation, and the kidneys;
for women too as hip baths, and as inhalations of fumes
or smoke for dilation of the uterus. If there is no
cinnamon at hand then twice as much of this mixed with
medicines will do the same things. It is very effective for
many things.
1-13. KINAMOMON 
SUGGESTED: Cinnamomum zeylanicum,
Laurus cinnamomum, Persea cinnamomum — Cinnamon 
 Canella alba — Wild Cinnamon 
There are many kinds of cinnamon with several
names proper to the countries where they grow, but
the best is that which they call mosulum because in a way
it bears a similarity to that cassia which they call mosulitis.
Of this choose that which is new, black in colour,
inclining to an ash colour like that of wine, with slender
smooth shoots, full of lasting knots, especially fragrant.
For most commonly to discern which is best depends on
 18
 BOOK ONE: AROMATICS

the sweetness of its smell. For that which is the best and
the most special has a smell resembling rue [3-52, 3-53,
4-98] or cardamom, and furthermore it is sharp and biting 
to the taste, somewhat salty with heat, when rubbed not
easily made rough, and when broken downy, with
smoothness between the knots. Test it as follows by
taking a shoot from one root (for this trial is easy), for
there are some fragments mixed in, and at the first trial
the best gives off a sweet taste and fills the nose with the
scent of it and hinders discerning the worst. There is also
a mountain variety — thick, dwarfish, of a very glittering
colour. And there is a third from Mosul — black, and with 
a very sweet taste, shrubby and without many knots. The
fourth kind is white, fungal, pushed up to sight, and vile
and brittle, with a great root, smelling like cassia. The fifth 
sort bites the nose with its smell, is reddish-yellow, and its 
bark is very like red cassia — but it is solid to the touch,
not very thin, with a thick root. Of these that which has a
smell like frankincense, cassia or amomum [1-14] is the
worst in smell. Choose that which is white, rough, and
with a coarse bark, but avoid that which is smooth and
woody around the root as useless. There is another
somewhat like it that is called bastard cinnamon — vile,
with a faint smell and weak strength. It is called ginger
xylocinnamomum [xylo — wood], having some similarity
to cinnamon. There is also woody cinnamon that has
long and strong shoots but is much inferior in sweetness
of smell. It is said by some that this xylocinnamomum
differs in kind from cinnamon having another nature.
Now all cinnamon is warming, diuretic, softening and
digestive. It draws out the menstrual flow and is an
abortifacient, taken as a drink with myrrh [1-73, 1-77,
4-116] or else applied. It is also good against beasts that
put out their poison and against deadly poisons
[antidote]. It cleans away, heats and thins pus that
darkens the pupils, and is diuretic. Rubbed on with
honey it takes away freckles and sunburn. It is good for
coughs and mucosal discharges, dropsy, diseases of the
kidneys, and difficult urination. It is mixed with precious
ointments and in general it is effective for many things. It
is prepared for storage by being pounded into small
pieces, put into wine, and dried in the shade.

1-14. AMOMON
SUGGESTED: Amomum repens, Elettaria cardamomum, 
Alpina cardamom  — Bastard Cardamom, Lesser Cardamom
Amomum aromaticum [Mabberley] — Bengal Cardamom 
see 1-5
Amomum is a little shrub winding out of the wood
within itself the same way as racemus [1-49], and it
has a little flower like that of the leucoion [3-138] but leaves 
like bryonia [4-184]. The best is brought out of Armenia
with a good colour, a pale reddish wood and a very
fragrant smell. Because it grows in plain and watery
places that from Media is weaker. It is large, a pale green,
soft to touch, and full of veins in the wood, resembling
origanum in its smell. That which comes from Pontus is a
pale red, neither long nor hard to break, clustered, full of
fruit, and biting to smell. Choose that which is new and
white or a faint red, not that which is close and adhering
together, but that which is loose and diffused, full of
seeds like the kernels of grapes, heavy, very fragrant,
without rottenness or mould, and sharp, biting to the
taste, a single and not many colours. 
It is warming, astringent and drying. It causes sleep
and relieves pain applied as a poultice to the forehead. It
ripens and dissolves inflammation and scalded sores of
the head. It is also good for those stricken by scorpions
applied as a poultice with basil. It helps gout, and it helps
and soothes inflammation of the eyes, and those with
haemorrhoids in their bowels; and it is effective for
female problems or damage both as suppositories and
baths. The liquid medicine (taken as a drink) is good for
liver disorders, defective kidneys and gout, and it is
mixed with antidotes and the most precious ointments.
Some adulterate amomum with amomis [Amomis pimenta]
that is like amomum yet without smell and without fruit. It 
grows in Armenia and has a flower like origanum. As a
rule to prevent deception avoid the fragments and
choose those that have perfect branches out of one root.

1-15. KOSTOS
SUGGESTED: Costus arabicus, Costus speciosus,
 Amomum hirsutum, Saussurea costus [Mabberley] 
— Arabian Costus, Kust-root [Bedevian], Costus Root
Modern costus is not the same as that known by the ancients — Jaquin, in Loudon.
The Arabic costus is best — white and light, with a
noticeable pleasant smell; next is the Indian — full,
light and black like ferula. The third is the Syrian — heavy, 
the colour of box, with a biting smell. The best is new,
white, full throughout, thick, dry, not worm-eaten, not
with a stinking smell but with a biting hot taste. 
It is warming and diuretic, expels the menstrual flow,
and is good for diseases of the uterus applied in
suppositories, as irrigations [douches], or as warm packs.
Two ounces (taken in a drink) helps someone bitten by a
viper, chest conditions and convulsions. It is given for gas 
in the stomach with wine and wormwood [3-26], taken
with mead [honey wine] it draws out venom, and taken
in water it draws out worms through the rectum. An
ointment of it made with oil helps those who have chills
from fever before an expected fit, and similarly helps the
paralysed. Rubbed on with water or honey it takes away
sunburn. It is also mixed in warm compresses and
antidotes. Some adulterate it by mixing in the strongest
roots of commagene [1-27]. The difference is easily
discerned. For this helenium neither burns the tongue nor
yields a pleasant, strong, biting smell. 
1-16. SCHOINOS
SUGGESTED: Schoenus incanus — Bog Rush
 Juncus conglomeratus, Juncus effusus — Rushes, Sweet Rushes 
Juncus arabicus — Rush, Sea Rush 
see schoenus 4-52
Juncus odoratus grows in Libya and Arabia and in that
part of Arabia called Nabataea, and this is the best. The
Arabic is next, but that from Libya is useless. Choose that
which is new, red, and full of flowers; which when cut or
cleft inclines to a purple colour, is thin, smells sweet like a
rose when it is rubbed between the hands, and bites the
 21
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

tongue with considerable burning. Use the flower, the
reeds and the root. It is diuretic, bringing down the
menstrual flow, and dissolving gaseousness. It causes
catarrh in the head. It is mildly astringent. It has a
breaking, digesting and opening strength. The flowers of
it used in drink are good for bloody vomiting and a
painful stomach, as well as the lungs, liver and kidneys. It 
is mixed with antidotes, but the root is more astringent
and therefore is given for a squeamish stomach. One
teaspoonful is good for dropsy and convulsions, and is
given for some days with the same amount of pepper. A
decoction of it as a hip bath is most convenient for
inflammation around the vulva. It is also called
Babylonian [juncus] or teuchitis.
1-17. KALAMOS EUODES
SUGGESTED: Acorus calamus, Acorus aromaticus,
 Acorus odoratus — Sweet Flag, Sweet Sedge, Myrtle Sedge 
Calamus ciliaris — Indian Palm 
see 1-2, 1-114
Calamus aromaticus grows in India and the best is
reddish-yellow, thick with knots, and when broken
it falls into many pieces. The reed is fibrous, somewhat
white, and slimy to chew, astringent and somewhat
sharp. Taken as a drink it is able to induce the movement
of urine. As a result it is good for dropsy, defective
kidneys, slow and painful urination and hernias, boiled
either with grapes or seeds of apium [3-77] and taken as a
drink. It draws out the menstrual flow taken as a drink
and applied. It helps coughs inhaled either alone or with
resin termininthos [1-91], the smoke taken in at the mouth
through a funnel. It is boiled for women's baths and
infusions, and mixed with warm compresses and
perfumes to make them smell sweeter.

SUGGESTED: Opalobalsamum, Balsamodendron gileadense,
Balsamodendron opalobalsamum, Commiphora opalobalsamum,
Amyris gileadensis — Balm of Gilead, Balm of Mecca
 Amyris kataf, Commiphora kataf, Balsamodendron kataf
— Balsam of Kataf
The tree balsamum is noted, similar in size to lycium
[1-132] or pyracantha [1-169, 1-170], with leaves like
rue [3-52, 3-53, 4-98] but a great deal paler and much more 
flourishing. It grows only in Judaea in a certain valley and 
in Egypt. Varying considerably in ruggedness, tallness
and slenderness, the part of the shrub that is thin, with
filaments, is called theriston, which may be because it is
easily mowed because of its slenderness. Opobalsamum is
the juice exuded by the tree when it is cut with iron nails
in the heat of the hottest days. But it drops so little that
every year they can get no more than six or seven congii
[three litre units approximately] of it, and a weight of it is
sold in that place for double its weight in silver. The best
juice is new, with a strong smell, pure and not inclining to 
sweetness, dissolving easily, smooth, astringent, and a
little biting to the tongue. It is prepared in various ways
for there are some who mix ointments with it such as
termininthos [1-91], cyprinum  [1-65], schininum [1-90],
susinum [1-62] or liliaceum [1-62], balaninum [1-40, 4-160]
and metopium [1-71], honey, waxy ointments, myrsinum
[1-48], or very liquid cyprinum [1-65]. These are easily
discerned for if the unmixed is dropped on a woollen
cloth and afterwards washed out it makes no stain or spot 
on it, but that which is counterfeited sticks. The pure
when put into water or milk is easily diffused and turns
like milk, but that which is counterfeited swims on the
top like oil, turning round or diffusing itself like a star.
But in time the pure will also turn thick and test worse
than any. Those are deceived who think that it is pure
when it is dropped into water, goes down to the bottom
first, and afterwards, easily diffusible, rises up again. The
wood is called xylobalsamum and the best liked is new
with slender stalks — red, sweet smelling, with a smell
somewhat resembling opobalsamum. Suitable use is made
of the fruit too. Choose that which is yellow, full, great,
heavy, biting in taste and hot in the mouth, somewhat
similar in taste to opobalsamum. From the town Petra a
 23
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK
Balsamodendron opalobalsamum
after FAGUET — 1888

seed like hypericum [3-171] is brought with which they
counterfeit this fruit. You may discover this because it is
bigger, and empty with no strength, and tastes of pepper.
The juice has the most strength as it heats the most,
cleaning away things that darken the pupils, and curing
abrasions around the vulva applied with waxy ointments 
and rosaceum [1-53]. It expels the menstrual flow and the
afterbirth, is an abortifacient, and rubbed on dissolves
chills and the filthy matter of boils. Taken as a drink it is a
concoction for rejuvenation and moving urine. Given
with milk it is also good for difficult breathers and those
who have taken a drink of aconitum [4-77, 4-78]; also for
those bitten by snakes. It is mixed with fatigue removers,
warm compresses and antidotes. Generally the juice of
the balsamum has the most strength, next to that the fruit,
but the wood has the least strength of all. Taken in a drink 
the fruit is good for pleurisy, pneumonia, coughs,
sciatica, epilepsy, vertigo, asthma, griping, difficulty in
conception, and for those bitten by snakes. It is suitable
for women's inhalations in fumes, and boiled for hip
baths it opens the vulva and extracts moisture. The wood
has the same virtues the fruit has but to a lesser degree.
Boiled in water and taken as a drink it helps in digestion,
griping, those bitten by snakes, and convulsions, and it
expels urine. With dry iris it is good for wounds in the
head. It also extracts scaly bones. It is mixed for the
thickening of ointments. 
1-19. ASPALATHOS
SUGGESTED: Aspalathus indica — Indian Aspalathus 
Aspalathus is a woody kind of shrub with many prickly 
thorns — growing in Istrus, Nisyrus, Syria and
Rhodes — which the ointment makers use for thickening
their ointments. The best is heavy, and after it has been
harvested inclining to a red or a purple colour, thick,
fragrant, and bitter to the taste. There is also another kind
of it with scattered bristles or thorns — white, woody,
without any smell — which is considered the worst. It has 
a heating and astringent quality. As a result, boiled in
wine and gargled, it is good for an ulcerated mouth and
gangrenous ulceration in the genitals. It is infused for
unclean discharges and fetid nasal discharges; and put

into a pessary it is an abortifacient. A decoction stops
bowels, and taken as a drink it stops bloody vomiting,
and dissolves painful urination and gaseousness. It is also 
called sphagnon, or phasganon, the Syrians call it diaxylon,
and some, erysisceptron.
1-20. BRUON
SUGGESTED: Lupus salictarius, Lupulus, 
Humulus [Fuchs, Brunfels], Lupulus mas [Bauhin],
 Humulus lupulus [Linnaeus] — Hops
Splachnum and Bryum have been used to name various mosses in modern times
[Loudon].
Bryum is sometimes called splanchnon. It is found on
trees such as cedars, white poplars or oaks: the best
grows on cedar, next is that which grows on white
poplar. That which smells sweetest and is white is the
best, but that which is black is the worst. Bryum is
astringent. Used either hot or cold it is good in decoctions
made for all those disorders requiring bathing around the 
vulva. It is mixed with ointments made for suppositories,
with other ointments for the astringent quality in it, for
the preparation of perfumes, and is put into medicines
called acopi [to remove fatigue].
1-21. AGALLOCHON
SUGGESTED: Aquilaria agallocha, Cynometra agallocha, 
Aloëxylon agallochum — Agallochum, Indian Aloe Tree,
Calambac Tree 
 Aquilaria malaccensis — Eagle-wood — Agallochum 
fragrant resinous heartwood
Agallochum is a kind of wood like thyine wood that is
brought out of India and Arabia distinguished by
spots of a sweet scent, somewhat astringent to the taste,
with some bitterness, and bark like soft skin somewhat
over-coloured. 
When it is chewed and a decoction of it is gargled up
and down in the mouth it causes sweet breath. The
powder sprinkled on the whole body serves to deodorise
it. It is used in perfumes instead of frankincense. One
teaspoonful of the roots (taken in a drink) lessens moist
 27
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK
Aquilaria malaccensis

disorders of the stomach, its weakness and heat. It is good 
taken as a drink with water for those who have pains of
the rectum, for the liver, dysentery and griping. 
1-22. NASKAPHTHON
UNKNOWN
nasceus — nascor — plants used by women
Nascaphthum some call narcaphthon and this is also
brought out of India. It is a bark like the rind of the
mulberry tree, used for a perfume for the sweet smell it
has, and put into artificial perfumes. Taken as inhalations 
of fumes or smoke it is good for constriction of the vulva. 
1-23. KANKAMON
SUGGESTED: Amyris ambroisiaca, Protium icicaraba, 
Icica icicarabica — Gum Elemi Tree 
Cancamum is the oozing of an Arabic tree resembling
myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116], poisonous to the taste,
which they use as a perfume. They make a perfume with
it for their cloths with myrrh and styrax. It is reported to
be able to make fat bodies lean — a half teaspoonful taken 
as a drink with water or vinegar and honey for many
consecutive days. It is given to the splenetic, epileptic and 
asthmatic. Taken with honey and water it brings down
the menstrual flow, and it quickly takes off scars in the
eyes and heals their moisture diluted in wine. For gums
rotten from moisture and toothache it helps as nothing
else can do. 
1-24. KUPHI 
Cyphi — a perfume
Cyphi is the composition of a perfume welcome to the
Gods. The priests in Egypt use it abundantly. It is
also mixed with antidotes and it is given to the asthmatic
in drinks. There are many ways that the manufacture of it 
is carried out, including the following. Take one litre of
cyprus [1-124], the same amount of ripe juniper berries,
 28
 BOOK ONE: AROMATICS

six kilos of stoned plump raisins of the sun, two and a half 
kilos of resin (cleaned again), a half kilo each of calamus
aromaticus [1-2, 1-17, 1-114], aspalathus [1-19] and juncus
odoratus [4-52, 1-16], twelve teaspoonfuls of myrrh [1-77,
1-73, 4-116], five litres of old wine and one kilo of honey.
Having removed the stones from the raisins pound them
and work them together with the wine and myrrh.
Pound and sift the other things, mix them with these, and 
let them drink up the liquid for one day. Afterwards boil
the honey until it comes to a glutinous consistency, mix
the melted resin carefully with it, and then having
pounded all the other things diligently together, put
them into a clay jar.
1-25. KROKOS
SUGGESTED: Croci flores et folia [Fuchs], Crocus sativus
[Bauhin], Crocus sativus var officinalis [Linnaeus] 
—  Saffron Crocus
Corycian crocum is the best for bodily use — new and
well-coloured, having somewhat white tendrils,
somewhat long, having all its parts hard to break,
without fat, full, colouring the hands, not decayed or
moist, alluring in scent and a little sharper; for that which
is not such is either old or steeped. The next best after the
Corycian comes from that tract of land near Lycia; and
that from Olympus [a mountain] in Lycia; then that from
Aegis Aetolia. But the Cyrenaican and that from
Centuripinum are the weakest in strength of all in Sicily,
all of them being cultivated like vegetables. Nevertheless, 
because it is full of juice and well coloured, they in Italy
(dying thyine wood with it) do use this, and for this it is
sold at a high rate. For medicine, that which was
previously described is more effective. It is adulterated
with a mixture of crogomagma [1-26] pounded or daubed
with sapa [syrup of new wine], lithargyrum [5-102] or
plumbago [5-100] pounded together with it to make it
weigh more. All this is discerned by the dustiness that is
found amongst it, and by the smell of the boiled down
new wine it has. 
It is digestive, softening, somewhat astringent and
diuretic. It causes a good colour, and it is good taken as a
drink with passum [raisin wine] against overindulgence.
 29
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

It stops excessive discharges of the eyes applied with
woman’s milk. It is effective mixed with drinks that are
taken internally, and with suppositories and poultices for 
the uterus and the perineum. It works against venereal
diseases, and rubbed on it soothes inflammation that
accompanies erysipelas [a skin inflammation], and it is
good for inflammations of the ears. They say also that it
will kill one if three teaspoonfuls are taken as a drink with 
water. In order to pound it smaller it must be dried in the
sun in a hot ceramic jar, and it must often be quickly
turned. The root of it (taken in a drink with passum [raisin
wine]) causes an urge to urinate. It is also called castor, or
cynomorphos, and the Magi call it sanguis Herculis.
1-26. KROKOMAGMA
SUGGESTED: Crocus sativus var officinalis [Linnaeus]
— Saffron Oil Dregs 
Crocomagma is made from oil of saffron, the aromatic
part squeezed out and made into lozenges. The best
is sweet-smelling, somewhat resembling the taste of
myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116], heavy and black, with no
woodiness in it; and which sufficiently diluted is the
colour of saffron — smooth, yellow underneath, strongly
colouring the teeth and tongue and lasting many hours
together, like that from Syria. It has the ability to clean
and cleans away things which darken the pupils. It is
diuretic, softening, digestive and warming. It somewhat
resembles the strength of saffron for it is made from this.

SUGGESTED: Elenium, Inula, Enula campania [Fuchs],
Helenium vulgare [Bauhin], Inula helenium [Linnaeus],
Inula campana, Aster helenium, Aster officinalis

Helenium has narrow leaves like verbascum [4-104],
only sharper and somewhat long. In some places it
puts out no stalks at all. The root below is fragrant, great,
somewhat sharp, from which for planting (as in lilies or
arum) the most pleasant shoots are taken. It grows in
hilly, shady and moist places. The root is dug up in the

summer, cut and dried. A decoction (taken as a drink)
induces the movement of urine and the menstrual flow.
The root itself (taken in a syrup with honey) helps
coughs, asthma, hernias, convulsions, gaseousness, and
the bites of venomous creatures, being generally
warming. The leaves boiled in wine are effectively
applied to those who have sciatica. The root is good for
the stomach preserved in passum [raisin wine]. The
confectioners, drying it a little and afterwards boiling it,
then steep it in cold water and put it into a decoction they
keep in jars for use. Pounded and taken in a drink it is
good for bloody excretions. It is also called symphyton,
persica, medica, orestion, nectarion, cleonia, rubus idaeus  or
verbascum idaeum; the Romans call it  terminalium, others,
inula campana, and the Egyptians call it lone.
1-28. ELENION AIGUPTION
UNKNOWN
Crateuas mentions another helenium that grows in
Egypt. It is a herb with branches a foot long
spreading on the ground like serpyllum [3-46], its many
leaves around the branches like those of lenticule [?lentil]
but longer; the roots a pale colour, the thickness of the
little finger, thin below but thicker above, with a black
rind. It grows in places bordering on the sea and on
hillocks and rocks. One root of it (taken in a drink with
wine) is able to help those bitten by snakes.

OILS
1-29. ELAION OMOTRIBES
SUGGESTED: Olea europaea, Olea sativa, Olea lancifola 
— New Oil from Unripe Olives
Oil from unripe olives is the best to use for health.
The best is considered that which is new, not biting, 
with a sweet smell. This is also effective for the
preparation of ointments. It is also good for the stomach
because it is therapeutic for the bowels, and when held in
the mouth it contracts loose gums, strengthens the teeth
and represses sweating. 
1-30. ELAION KOINON
SUGGESTED: Olea europaea — Old Olive Oil 
That which is the oldest and most fat is the most fit for
bodily uses. Commonly all oil is warming and softens 
flesh, keeping the body from being easily chilled with
cold, making it more ready to perform actions. It is good
for the digestive system, and has a softening strength,
dulling the strength of ulcerating medicines in mixtures.
It is given against poisons, taken immediately and
vomited up again. A half-pint purges, taken as a drink
with the same amount of barley water or with water. Six
glassfuls (boiled with rue [3-52, 3-53, 4-98] and taken as a
drink) are given effectively to those troubled with
griping, and it expels worms. This is administered
especially for obstruction of the intestines, but the older
oil is more heating and violently dispersing. It is a good
ointment to sharpen the eyesight. If there is no old oil at
hand, new oil must be mixed as follows. Pour it out into
the best jar at hand, and boil it until it is the thickness of
honey. Then use it, for it is has an equal strength.

OILS

1-31. ELAION AGRIAS ELAIAS
SUGGESTED: Olea sylvestris, Olea sylvestris var oleaster
— Wild Olive Oil 
Oil from the wild olive is more astringent and the
second choice for good health. It is convenient
instead of rosaceum [1-53] for headaches, and stops
sweating and hair falling out [ alopecia]. It cleans off
dandruff, ulcers that penetrate the head, parasitic skin
diseases, and psoriasis, and it keeps grey hair away for a
long time from those who are rubbed with it daily. 
1-32. ELAION LEUKON
To Whiten Oil
Oil is made white as follows. Taking oil which is a
clear colour and not over a year old, pour it out into
a new broad-mouthed ceramic jar. Let there be an
amount of fifty pints. Afterwards, placing it in the sun,
pour it back again with a spoon every day around noon,
letting it fall down from on high, so that it may be altered
by frequent rolling and beating, and foam. Then on the
eighth day steep fifty teaspoonfuls of clean fenugreek in
warm water, put it thus softened into the former oil
without straining out the water. Also add the same
weight of pinewood now (as fat as may be and cut into
small pieces), and let eight more days pass. After this time 
stir the oil up and down again with a spoon. Finally, if it is 
white, pour it out into a new jar (first rinsed around with
old wine) and store it, having first scattered in eleven
teaspoonfuls of the corolla of melilot flowers [3-48] and
the same amount of iris. If it is not (yet white) it must be
set out again in the sun and treated until it becomes
white.
1-33. ELAION SIKUONION
SUGGESTED:  Olea europaea, Olea sativa, Olea lancifola,
 Sicyonium — Sicyonian Oil
We may prepare Sicyonian olive oil as follows. Pour
out four and a half litres of new unripe olive oil
 35
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

and the white oil [above] into a broad-mouthed kettle
covered with tin, add two and a quarter litres of water,
and boil it over a gentle fire stirring softly. When it has
boiled up twice take it away from the fire, and having
cooled it, skim off the oil with a spoon. Afterwards add
other water, boil it again, and repeat the procedure, and
then store it. This oil is mostly made in Sicyonia and is
therefore called  sicyonium . It is somewhat warming,
suitable for fevers and affected nerves. Women use it to
have a clean skin.
1-34. RUPOS
Grime from the baths 
The scrapings which are taken up in public baths are
able to heat, soften, and disperse fluids, and are good

Elaeoptene is the liquid part of a volatile oil, Stearoptene the solid part of a volatile

Elaeomeli flows out of a certain stem and root of a plant
growing in Palmyra, a region of Syria, more thick
than honey and sweet in taste, which (taken as a drink of
two cups to one half-pint of water) drives dyspepsia and
bilious fluids out through the bowels. Those who take it
become sluggish and deficient in virility, but this should
not disturb us. They are to be kept awake and not
allowed to be overcome by too deep a sleep. 
Oil is also prepared from the fat of the young olive
shoots, the old oil being best — thick, fat, not cloudy. It
warms, and is effective rubbed on for those things that
darken the pupils, and daubed on is good for leprosy and
painful nerves.

Cicinum is prepared as follows. Take ripe cicinum
seeds (as much as you think suitable) and dry them
in the sun, scattering them along as they used to do
grapes until the bark that closes them in when broken
apart falls off; then gathering the flesh or pulp together
put it into a mortar, and having pounded it carefully put
it into a kettle with a tin cover that has water in it, and

placing fire underneath, make it boil. When you have
removed all the moisture, take the kettle from the fire and 
collect the oil that swims on top with a spoon and bottle
it. Because the Egyptians use it in great abundance they
prepare it differently. After they have picked them they
place the seeds into a mill and grind them carefully; then
throwing the grinds into baskets they squeeze it out with
a press. The seeds are in season or ripe when they are rid
of the small bladders that enfold them. 
This oil of cicinum is good for ulcers that penetrate the
head, parasitical skin diseases, inflammation of the
perineum, and obstructions and damage to the uterus, as
well as scars faedas [from goring by horned animals], and
earache. Mixed with plasters it makes them more
effective. Taken as a drink it draws out watery matter
through the bowels, and it also draws out worms. 
1-39. ELAION AMYGDALINON
SUGGESTED: Amagdalinum — Metopium — Almond Oil 
  — Prunus amygdalus var amara — Bitter Almond
RAW SEED OF BITTER ALMOND IS POISONOUS.
Amagdalinum oil or metopium is made as follows.
Having picked and dried four quarts of bitter
almonds beat them gently with a wooden pestle in a
mortar until they are pulped. Pour on them one pint of
hot water and let them absorb it for half an hour, from
which time beat it strongly again. Then press it on a
board, squeeze it out, and take that which sticks to your
fingers into a spoon. Afterwards pour a half-pint of water
into that which was squeezed out, and allow it to be
absorbed, and repeat as before. Four quarts of seeds make 
one half-pint of oil. It is effective against womb pains,
constriction, the womb turning around, and things that
darken the same places, as well as headaches, ear
problems, resonance, and tinnitus. It helps inflammation
of the kidneys, illness meientes [ urination], stones
[urinary, kidney], asthma and splenitis. Furthermore it
removes spots from the face, sunburn, and wrinkles on
the skin mixed with honey, the root of lily and Cyprian
rosewax. With wine it mends moisture of the pupils of
the eye, and removes penetrative ulcers and dandruff.

water as was previously described in amagdalinum [1-39].
Then place it in the sun and mix it until it turns black and
has a strong smell. Then, having strained it through a

1-48. MURSINELAION
SUGGESTED:  Myrtus communis var romana 
— Broad-leaved Myrtle 
see 1-155, 4-146, 4-165b
Myrsinum oil is prepared as follows. Take the tender
leaves of black myrtle (whether wild or planted),
beat them, pressing out the juice, then mixing the same
amount of unripe olive oil with the juice warm it over
coals until it is boiled together, spooning up that which
floats on top. An easier method of preparation is to boil
the tenderest leaves (after they have been pounded) in
water and oil, and to skim off the oil that swims on the
top. Another way is (having laid the leaves in the sun) to
steep them in oil. There are some thicken the oil first with
malicoria (?), cupressus [1-102] and juncus odoratus  [4-52,
1-16].
The most effective oil inclines towards bitterness in its
taste, and is oily, green and transparent, and smells of
myrtle. It is astringent and hardening; as a result it is
effective mixed with medications for hardening. It is
good for burns, penetrative ulcers in the head, dandruff,
pimple eruptions, chapped skin, galls (?), joints, and
joints loosening. It represses sweats, and is good for all
things that need an astringent or thickening.

Daphne-Alexandrina [Brunfels], Ruscus hypoglossum
[Linnaeus], Ruscus hippoglossum, Uvularia, Baslingua
 — Laurel of Caesar [Mabberley], Horse Tongue,
Double Tongue
 Laurus nobilis — Sweet Bay, Laurel, Roman Laurel
Laurinum is made from overripe bay berries (which are 
ready to fall from the tree) boiled in water, because
they send up a certain kind of fat from the husk enclosing 
them, which is squeezed out by hand and scooped up in
spoons. Some first thicken oil of unripe olives with
cypress, juncus odoratus  [4-52, 1-16] and calamus [1-17],
and after this (throwing in the tender leaves of bay) boil
them together. There are some who add bay berries to
 46
OILS

this until it smells enough of bay; some also mix in styrax
[1-79] and myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116]. The best bay for the
manufacture of oil is mountainous and broad-leaved.
The best oil of bay is new and greenish in colour — very
bitter and sharp. It is warming and softening, opening
blood vessels that were shut, and overcoming
exhaustion. It is good for all infirmities around the
tendons, earaches, and for those troubled with dripping
mucus. It is an excellent ointment, as good as anything
else for those with kidneys inflamed because of cold.
Taken as a drink it is nauseating.

Terminthinus — [old English] Termenteyne 
— Turpentine Tree — Pistacia terebinthus 
Schininum [lentiscinum] is made from ripe berries the
same as oil of bay, and thickened before use. It heals
parasitic skin diseases on beasts of burden and dogs
[veterinary]. It is effective mixed with suppositories,
remedies to remove fatigue, and medications for leprosy.
It also stops sweating. 
Terminthinos [1-91] is also made the same way. It cools
and binds.

Mastichinum is made from mastic pounded into small 
pieces. It is good for disorders in the womb —
gently warming, astringent, softening. It is also good laid
on the stomach for hardened swellings, for the
abdominal cavity and dysentery; and for cleaning away
spots on the face, and causing a good colour. The best is
compounded in the isle of Chios.

1-52. MURON SUNTHESIS
MEDICINAL OINTMENTS
Seeing that ointments also are effective for some
diseases, either mixed with other medicines, dropped 
on, poured on, or smelled, we thought it logical to make
this suggestion: that those who test them must determine 
whether the ointments smell exactly of those herbs from
which the mixture is made. This method of judgement is
the best. Yet this is not observed in some ointments
because of the prevalence of stronger ingredients, as in
amaracinum [1-68], crocinum [1-64] and telinum [1-57], as
well as some others, which are tested by sampling them
often.
1-53. RHODINON
SUGGESTED:  Rosa, Rosa hortensis et sylvestris [Fuchs],
Rosa rubra [Bauhin], Rosa gallica [Linnaeus] 
— Common Rose, French Rose — Oil of Roses 
Rosaceum oil is made as follows. Take five pounds
eight ounces of juncus odoratus [4-52, 1-16] and
twenty pounds five ounces of oil; bruise the juncus and
steep it in water, then boil it, stirring it up and down.
Strain it out into the twenty pounds five ounces of oil, put 
a thousand counted dry rose petals into it, and having
rubbed your hands with honey stir the mixture up and
down (every now and then squeezing the petals gently),
then after leaving them for a night, press them out. When 
the dregs have sunk down, change the receiving jar, and
store it in large bowls wiped with honey. Then throwing
the strained roses in a small washing jar pour on them
eight pounds and five ounces of the thickened oil and
strain them out again, and this will be the second
pressing; and if you will, for a third or fourth time pour
oil in again on the roses, and strain them out again. A first, 
second, third and fourth oil are made. Each time rub the
inside of the jars with honey. If you mean to make a
second insertion put the same number of new dry rose
 48
OINTMENTS 

petals into the oil that was first pressed out, and stirring it
up and down with hands smeared with honey, press it
out; and repeat in the same way the second, third and
fourth time, pressing it out again; and as often as you do
this put in fresh roses (paring off their stems) for this way
it becomes stronger. The oil can take this addition of roses 
seven times, but by no means any farther. Also rub the
press with honey. You ought to carefully separate the oil
from the juice for if even a little of it is left in there it will
corrupt the oil. Some use the roses alone, cut off their
stems or whites, and infuse them by placing them in the
sun, having the amount of half a pound of petals to one
pint of oil, changing the petals every eight days, and
leaving them in the sun for forty days, and then storing it. 
Some first thicken the oil by adding calamus [1-17] and
aspalathus [1-19]. Some include anchusa [4-23 to 4-26] to
give it a pleasant colour, and salt so that it does not spoil. 
It is astringent and cooling, good for cleaning and
mixing with poultices. Taken as a drink it loosens the
bowels and cools a heated stomach. It fills up hollow
boils, and makes soothing medications for malignancies.
It is a rub for penetrative ulcers, catarrh in the head, and
heated eruptions; and a lotion for headache as well as a
mouth rinse for the start of a toothache. It is good rubbed
on for eyelids that have grown hard, and it is good given
as a suppository for rosiones [ gnawing corrosion] or
irritations of the intestines and the vulva.

SUGGESTED: Elatinum, Ecballium elaterium, Ecballium agreste,
Momordica elaterium, Elaterium officinale — Oil of Cucumber,

Having broken and bruised the elaterium, put it into a
washing jar, and pour on it oil of unripe olives. Let
it remain for three days, and then take it up into a basket
and press it out. Use the same weight of each ingredient,
then, having stored it in a clean jar, use it. It has the same
uses as the rosaceum [1-53] but it does not soothe the
bowels.

SUGGESTED: Cotonea malus, Cydonia [Fuchs], 
Mala cotonea minora [Bauhin], Pyrus cydonia [Linnaeus],
Cydonia oblonga, Cydonia vulgaris — Quince
Oil of melinum is prepared as follows. Having mixed
together six pints of oil and ten pints of water, add
three ounces of bruised spatha [1-150] or elaterium [4-155]
and one ounce of juncus odoratus  [4-52, 1-16], and after
letting them lie together for a day, boil them. Afterwards,
(having strained out the oil) put it into a broad-mouthed
jar, lay over it a mat of reeds or some thin covering and
place the fruit of cydonia on top of it, covering them with
cloths. Allow them (to stand thus) for many days until the 
oil has extracted the strength from the quinces. Some
cover the fruit with cloths for ten days so that the sweet
smell may be kept in and not breathe out, afterwards they 
steep them in oil two days and two nights, and then press 
it out and bottle it.  It is astringent and cooling — effective 
for scabies [ itchy parasitical disease], ulcers, dandruff,
chilblains and shingles [herpes]. Used as drops it is good
for open disorders in the vulva, and given as a
suppository it stops urinary urgency, and represses
sweating. It is taken as a drink against vomiting from
ingesting dried beetles [2-65], bupressedes [2-66] and
pinorum [1-86]. The best is considered to smell like the
fruit of cydonia. 
1-56. OINANTHINON
SUGGESTED: Cissus digitata — Wild Grape, Sorrel Vine 
Vitis labrusca — Wild Grapes 
Oenanthemum. Having dried the sweet-smelling
shoots or buds of the wild grape, put it into oil of
unripe olives and stir it around, churn it upside down
and leave it so for two days. Afterwards strain it out and
store it. It is astringent, equivalent to rosaceum [1-53],
except it neither loosens nor softens the bowels. That
which carries the smell of the shoots or buds is the most
approved of.
 52
OINTMENTS 

1-57. TELINON
SUGGESTED: Foenograecum, Foenumgraecum [Fuchs],
Foenumgraecum sativum [Bauhin],
Trigonella foenum-graecum [Linnaeus], Telinum 
— Oil of Fenugreek
Take five pounds of fenugreek, nine pounds of oil, one 
pound of calamus [1-17] and two pounds of cyprus
[1-124], steep the herbs in the oil for seven days stirring it
up and down three times a day, and afterwards press it
out and store it. There are some who use cardamomum
[1-5] instead of calamus [1-17], and opobalsamum  [1-18]
instead of cyprus, and steep them together. Others first
thicken the oil with these, and afterwards steep the
fenugreek in there and strain it out.  It is able to soften
mature abscesses, and is especially good for hard lumps
around the uterus, and for obstinate body cavities,
dripped in when it becomes dry around those places, the
moist fluids having been formerly evacuated. Administer 
it for inflammation in the perineum, and for the
unproductive urge to evacuate. It cleans dandruff and
penetrative ulcers in the head, and it is good for burns
and chilblains. It gets off spots of sunburn with wax, and
it is mixed with medicines made to clean the face. Choose
that which is new, scours the hands, is bittersweet in taste 
and does not smell too much like fenugreek, for that is
the best. 
1-58. SAMPSUCHINON
SUGGESTED: Amaracus, Maiorana [Fuchs], Majorana vulgaris
[Bauhin], Sampsuchum, Sampsucum, Origanum majorum
[Pliny], Origanum majorana [Linneaus],
 Origanum majoranoides, Majorana hortensis 
— Sweet Marjoram, Knotted Marjoram
Take an amount each of serpyllum [3-46], cassia,
abrotanum [3-29], flowers of sisymbrium [2-155], leaves 
of myrtle [1-55, 4-146] and sampsuchum that by guess you
shall think suitable, having respect for the strength of
each. Beat all these together, and pour on them unripe
olive oil but not enough to overwhelm the strength of
those things which are steeped in it, and so leave it alone
for four days. Afterwards strain it and take the same
 55
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

amount of the same fresh herbs again and steep them for
another four days to make it stronger. Choose
sampsuchum that is a black, greenish colour, strongly
scented and quite sharp. This oil is warming and sharp,
reducing the intensity of symptoms. It is good for the
closing up and distortions of the vulva, extracts the
menstrual flow and afterbirth, is an abortifacient, and
refreshes constriction of the vulva. It lessens pains of the
abdomen and groin. It is best used with honey since it
hardens places with excessive  astringency, and rubbed
on it disperses exhaustion. It is effectively mixed with
poultices for tetanus and for other kinds of convulsions.
1-59. OKIMINON
SUGGESTED: Ocimum exiguum, Ocimum minutum, 
Ocimum mediocre, Ocimum magnum [Fuchs], Ocimum basilicum, 
Basilicum — Oil of Basil — Basil, Sweet Basil
Take twenty pounds of oil and eleven pounds eight
ounces of basil in weight, take off the leaves, steep
them in the oil for a night and a day, then press it out and
bottle it. Then take the leaves out of the basket, pour in
the same amount of oil on them again and press it out.
This is called that which follows, for it does not allow a
third steeping. Then take the same amount of new basil
and steep it again as described in instructions about
rosaceum [1-53]. Then pour in the oil from the first
steeping, let the leaves lie and soak in there an equal time, 
and afterwards strain it out and bottle it. If you wish to
steep it three or four times always put in new basil. It may 
also be made from unripe olives but the other way is best. 
It does the same things as sampsuchinum [above] but
not as effectively.
1-60. ABROTONINON
SUGGESTED: Abrotonum foemina [Fuchs], Absinthium ponticum
[Bauhin], Artemisia pontica [Linnaeus], Abrotanum mas

Abrotoninum is made as follows. Take eight pounds of
the leaves of abrotanum [3-29] and eleven pounds
 56
OINTMENTS 

five ounces of the oil aromatized with the ingredients
that go into cyprinum [see 1-65], and having steeped them 
in oil a day and a night, strain it out. If you wish to make it 
last a long time throw away the first leaves, put in other
leaves, steep them too, and strain it out. It is warming and 
good for closing up or hardness in the vulva, and
expelling the menstrual flow and afterbirth.
1-61. ANETHINON
SUGGESTED: Anethum hortense [Bauhin], Anethum graveolens
[Linnaeus], Peucedanum graveolens, Selinum athenum,
 Pastinaca athenum, Anethinum — Dill, Oil of Dill 
Steep eleven pounds and eight ounces of the flowers
of anethum for one day in eight pounds nine ounces of 
oil, then squeeze it out by hand and store it. If you wish to 
make a second steeping add new flowers of anethum. It
can soothe distress around the vulva and open it and is
effective for hard lumps on the gums, warming and
dissolving weariness, and is good for sores of the joints. 
1-62. SUSINON
SUGGESTED: Lilium, Lilium album [Fuchs],
 Lilium candidum [Linnaeus] — Madonna Lily
[other usage] Crinum toxicarium, Crinum asiaticum 
— White Lily, Lily Asphodel, Poison Bulb 
see 3-116
POISONOUS
Susinum is also called lilinum or liliaceum and is made as 
follows. After you have mixed together nine pounds
five ounces of oil, five pounds three ounces of calamus
[1-17] and five ounces of myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116] in
fragrant wine, boil it, let the oil run through a strainer,
pour it out again, and add three pounds six ounces of
cardamom (bruised and steeped in rain water). Allow it
to be sufficiently steeped together, then strain it out. Take 
three and a half pounds of this thickened oil and a
thousand (counted) lilies, and having stripped off their
leaves, put them in a broad but not deep jar. Pour in the
oil, stir it around with your hands (that have been
 59
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

previously rubbed with honey) and let it stand for a day
and a night. The next morning pour it into a cupped
strainer and presently (when it is strained) separate the
oil on top from the water that is strained out with it,
because it will not permit the water with it, like rosaceum
[1-53], but when heated together it grows hot again and is 
spoiled. Pour it out again into other jars smeared with
honey, first sprinkling a little salt in there and taking
away the filth carefully as it gathers together. Take the
strained aromatic stuff out of the basket, and placing it
into a broad jar pour in on it again the same amount of
the aromatised oil as at first. Put in ten teaspoons of
bruised cardamom, stir it well with your hands, and after
waiting a little strain it out, removing the filth off from
that which runs out. Pour on the oil again a third time,
repeat [the procedure] throwing in the cardamom and
the salt with it, and press it out (first smearing your hands 
with honey). That which was the first strained out will be
the best, the second the next after that, and the third the
least. Then take another thousand lilies and strip off their
leaves, lay them in order and pour on them the oil that
was first strained out. Work methodically, doing the
same things over again as you did at first, mingling
cardamom [as before and afterwards straining it out]. Do
the same the second and the third time, placing into it the 
cardamom, afterwards straining it out and repeating the
procedure. As often as you steep fresh lilies in there, (by
so much) you shall have the ointment stronger. Finally
when it seems to you that you have enough, mix with
every preparation seventy-two teaspoons of the best
myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116], ten teaspoons of crocus and
seventy-five teaspoons of cinnamon. Some take the same
amount of crocus and cinnamon (having pounded and
sifted it), put it into a jar with water, and pour on it the
ointment from the first pressing: afterwards (leaving it
alone a little while) they put it into little dry jars (first
smeared around with gum or myrrh and saffron and
honey diluted with water). Do the very same things to
the second and third pressings. Some make it with
nothing else but oil balaninum [1-40, 4-160] or some other
oil and lilies. The oil which is made in Phoenicia and in
Egypt is thought to excel most, the best being that which
smells [most] of lilies. 
It is warming and softening — opening closures and
inflammation around the vulva — and in general it is the
 60
OINTMENTS 

most effective of all for female ailments. It is also good for
scaly scalp, varicose veins, dandruff, and feruidae [from
fever] eruptions. It quickly alters vibices [marks from
blood under the skin during a fever] and makes them the
same colour as the rest of the skin. Generally it is very
purifying. Taken as a drink it expels bile through the
bowels, and induces the passage of urine; but it hurts the
stomach and causes nausea.

Narcissus pseudo-narcissus, Narcissus sylvestris
— Wild Narcissus, Daffodil, Lent Lily, Lent Rose 
 Narcissus poeticus, Narcissinum — Poet’s Narcissus,
Pheasant’s Eye — Oil of Narcissus 
Oleum narcissinum is thickened as follows. Take thirty 
pounds five ounces of washed oil and six pounds of 
aspalathum [1-19] (pounded and steeped in water). Mix it
with a third of the oil and boil it. Take out the aspalathum
and put in five pounds eight ounces of calamus [1-17] and
pounded sifted grains of myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116]
(steeped in old fragrant wine). Mix it and boil it and when 
it has boiled with these ingredients take it off. When it is
cold strain out the oil, then take the oil and pour it out
into a jar and add a large amount of narcissus flowers,
stirring it up and down for two days. Then as we said in
susinum [1-62], strain it out and repeatedly pour it out
from one jar to another, as it is also quickly spoiled. It is
good for damage in the vulva, softening hardness and
closures around it. It causes headaches, however.
1-64. KROCINON
SUGGESTED: Croci flores et folia [Fuchs], Crocus sativus
[Bauhin], Crocus sativus var officinalis [Linnaeus], Crocinum 
— Saffron Crocus — Oil of Crocus 
POISONOUS
Intending to prepare crocinum you must first of all
thicken the oil as was explained in susinum [1-62] with
the very same weight and amount. Take therefore three
 63
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

and a half pounds of the thickened oil of  susinum [1-62],
put in there eight teaspoons of crocus and stir it up and
down often each day, doing this continuously for five
days together. On the sixth day pour out the oil, separate
it from the crocus, pour in again on the same crocus the
same amount of new oil and stir it up and down for
thirteen days. Then having poured it all back again, mix
with it forty teaspoons of myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116]
(pounded and sifted), stir it around well in a mortar, and
bottle it. Some use as much aromatised oil for crocinum as
they do for cyprinum [1-65]. The best smells abundantly of 
crocus and this is fit for medicinal use, and the next best
smells of myrrh. It is warming and sleep-inducing, thus it
is often good for an unsound mind when [the head is]
moistened with it (or if it is merely smelled) or if the
nostrils are rubbed with it. It induces movement of pus,
cleans boils, and is good for hardness in the uterus (and
closure) and other ill afflictions there, with wax, crocus,
marrow, and double the oil. It digests, softens, moistens
and lessens. It is also good for glaucoma of the eyes
rubbed on with water. This is the same as butyrinum,
onychinum and styracinum — differing only in name but
having the same preparation and effect.
1-65. KUPRINON
SUGGESTED: Lawsonia alba, Lawsonia inermis  Cyprinum 
— Cyprus, Henna Shrub, Egyptian Privet — Oil of Cyprus
Take one part washed oil of unripe olives and a part
and a half of rainwater. Pour out some of this into the 
oil and mix the other with the aromata [fragrant herbs]
that are to be put in. Afterwards take five and a half
pounds of aspalathus [1-19], six and and half pounds of
calamus, one pound of myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116], three
pounds nine ounces of cardamom and nine pounds five
ounces of oil. Having bruised and steeped the aspalathus
throw it in the water, and boil it with the oil until it boils
together. Then steep the myrrh in old fragrant wine,
steep the bruised calamus together with the myrrh, and
taking out the aspalathus, put in this mixture of calamus.
When it has boiled together take down the kettle, strain
out the oil and pour it on the bruised cardamom and that
which was steeped in the rest of the water, and stir it
 64
OINTMENTS 

around with a continuous splashing — not stopping until 
it is cold. Afterwards strain out the oil and put forty-six
pounds eight ounces of cyprus [1-65] flowers into
twenty-eight pounds of oil, allow them to be steeped,
and strain them through a wicker basket. If you would
have more of it place in again the same amount of new
flowers, strain it out in same way again, and if you will
you may steep it a third and a fourth time for in this way
it is made more effective. Choose that which is good and
which strongly impresses [the nostrils] with its sweet
smell. Some also mingle cinnamon with it. It has a
warming, softening quality, opening the mouths [of the
blood vessels], good for disorders of the vulva and nerves 
and for pleurisy and fractures, both alone as well as
mixed with a stiff ointment. It is also put into softening
medicines made to help those troubled with stiff
convulsions of the neck, as well as those troubled with
angina, and for inflammation of the groin. It is also put
into medicines against weariness.

SUGGESTED: Iris germanica [Fuchs, Brunfels, Linnaeus],
 Iris vulgaris Germanica sive sylvestris [Bauhin], Irinum 
— German Iris, Blue Flower de Luce, Flowering Ring

POISONOUS
Take six pounds eight ounces of spatha or elata [1-150]
(pounded as small as possible) and seventy three
pounds five ounces of oil. Mix it with five pints of water,
place it into a brass jar and boil it until it absorbs the smell
of spatha; afterwards strain it out into a basin smeared
with honey. From this aromatised oil the first irinum is
prepared, the iris being steeped in the thickened oil as
described below. Or else do the following. Take five
pounds two ounces of xylobalsamum [1-18] and seventy
pounds five ounces of oil, and having pounded them as
above, boil them together. Afterwards take out the
xylobalsamum, put in nine pounds ten ounces of bruised
calamus [1-17] [as well as an equal weight of] grains of
myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116] steeped in old fragrant wine.
Afterwards take fourteen pounds of this thickened and
aromatised oil, steep the same weight of bruised iris in
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

there, leave it undisturbed for two days and two nights,
and afterwards strain it out lustily and forcibly. If you
would have it stronger add the same amount [of iris],
steeping similarly the same amount a second and third
time, then strain it out. The best by far smells of nothing
else but only of iris, such as that made in Perga,
Pamphylia and that made in Elis, Achaia. It is softening
and warming, and it cleans crusted ulcers, decaying flesh
and filth, and it is good for conditions around the vulva,
and for inflammation and closures of it. It expels a birth
and opens haemorrhoids. It is good for noises in the ears
applied with vinegar, rue [3-52, 3-53, 4-98] and bitter
almonds. For dripping mucus that has endured long the
nostrils are rubbed with it, and also for fetid nasal polyps.
A drink of a wine cupful purges the bowels, is good for
suffering of the stomach, encourages urine, and is good
for those who have difficulty vomiting, their fingers
being rubbed with it [to put down the throat] or given
with other things that cause vomiting. It is good rubbed
on for angina or gargled with honey and water, and also
for roughness of the arteries. It is given as an antidote to
those who have taken a drink of hemlock, fungi or
coriander. 
1-67. GLEUCINON
SUGGESTED: Gleucinum — Syruped Pulp of Grapes in Oil,
Oil of Must
Gleucinum simplex  is prepared from oil of unripe
olives, schoinos [rushes], calamus [1-17], Celtic nard
[1-7], spatha [1-150], aspalathus [1-19], melilot [3-48], costus
[1-15] and must. The vinandea [must] is laid in the jar that
contains the aromata [fragrant herbs] with the wine and
oil. It is stirred up and down twice every day for thirty
days and then strained out and stored. It is warming,
softening and relaxing; good for chills, sinewy diseases
and disorders of the vulva. It is more effective than acopon
[medicines to remove fatigue] being softening. 
 68
OINTMENTS 

1-68. AMARAKINON
SUGGESTED: Amaracinum — Parthenium,
Cotula foetida [Fuchs], Chamaemelum foetidum [Bauhin], 
Anthemis cotula [Linnaeus] — Mayweed [Mabberley]
[other usage] Origanum amaracus — Amaracus 
Origanum dictamnus, Dictamnus creticus, Amaracus dictamnus
— Dittany of Crete 
The best amaracinum is made in Cyzicum. It is made
from the oils of unripe olives and balaninum [1-40,
4-160]; thickened with xylobalsamum [1-18], schoenus [4-52] 
and calamus [sweet flag] but sweetened with amaracus
and costus [1-15], amomum [1-14], nard [1-6, 1-7, 1-8, 1-10],
carpobalsam [fruit of opalobalsamum, 1-18] and myrrh [1-77,
1-73, 4-116]. Those who make it expensively include
cinnamon. Honey and wine are used both for rubbing
the jars and steeping the aromata [fragrant herbs] that
have been pounded. It is warming, sleep-inducing,
opening the blood vessels, softening, heating and
diuretic — effective for decaying flesh, fistulas, and
watery ruptures occuring after the help of surgery. It
breaks cradle cap on all sides and efferata [growing
outwards] ulcers, and it is good for difficult urination (the 
perineum or buttocks and anus rubbed with it), and it is
also good rubbed on for inflammation of the same places,
and for opening haemorrhoids. Applied to the uterus it
induces passage of the menstrual flow, and dissolves
hardness and oedema [water retention] in the vulva. It is
good for hurt tendons and muscles, moistened and
applied in thin pads of wool. There is also a kind of oil
which naturally and of its own accord drops out of the
rock, with a sweet smell and a certain heaviness. It is
found in Arabia and Italy and is very effective for many
uses. It is able to dry, open, and glue tendons together. It
is good for scabs and ulcers, and it also lessens and
subdues wind.

1-69. MEGALEION
SUGGESTED: Megalium — Parthenium, Cotula foetida [Fuchs],
Chamaemelum foetidum [Bauhin], Anthemis cotula [Linnaeus] 
— Mayweed [Mabberley]
That which is called megalium used to be made but is
no longer, yet for the completeness of the history it
will not be out of place to speak something of it. The
mixture of this is the same as amaracinum [1-68] but there
is resin added to it so that it differs only in that. It is gently
softening. Resin is mixed with the oils neither for
preservation nor delight’s sake but only to colour and
thicken them. Turpentine is also mixed with it and boiled
until it stops smelling. The method of boiling it is
explained in the section on resin.
1-70. HEDYCHROON
SUGGESTED: Hedychroon — Parthenium, Cotula foetida [Fuchs],
Chamaemelum foetidum [Bauhin], Anthemis cotula [Linnaeus] 
— Mayweed [Mabberley]
That which is called hedychroon and which is made in
Co has the same strength and the same method of
preparation as amaracinum [1-68] but it smells sweeter.
1-71. METOPION
SUGGESTED: Ferula galbaniflua, Metopium — Galbanum
An ointment is prepared in Egypt which they call
metopium because they mix galbanum with it, for the
wood out of which galbanum is made they call metopium.
A mixture is made of bitter almonds, oil of unripe olives
and cardamom, schoenus [4-52], calamus [1-17], honey,
wine, myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116], seeds of balsam [1-18],
galbanum and resin. The best smells strongly and is fat,
resembling cardamom and myrrh rather than galbanum.
It heats and burns considerably and it also opens the
mouths of blood vessels. It draws and purges ulcers. It is
effective applied with antiseptic plasters for strength,
muscles that have been cut, and watery lungs. It is mixed
with warm compresses and stiff ointments. It is good for
 72
OINTMENTS 

chills and reversed curved bodies in convulsions. It
encourages sweat, opens closed blood vessels of the
uterus and loosens hardness around it, and in general it
has a softening quality.
1-72. MENDESION
SUGGESTED: Mendesium — Resin Compound
Mendesium is made from balanine oil [1-40, 4-160],
myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116], cassia and resin. Some,
after they have put in everything by weight, additionally
put in a little cinnamon, but this is unneccessary because
the things that are not pounded together do not yield
their strength. It has similar properties to metopium [1-71]
yet to a lower degree.
1-73. STACTE
SUGGESTED: Commiphora abyssinica — Coarse Myrrha 
Commiphora myrrha — Myrrh Tree, Myrrha 
Stacte — Oil of new Myrrh 
see 1-77, 4-116
Stacte is the fat of new myrrh bruised with a little water
and pressed out with an instrument. It has a very
sweet smell, is precious, and by itself makes an ointment
called stacte. The approved stacte is not mixed with oil and 
has a great deal of strength in a little amount, with a
warming quality similar to myrrh and hot oils. 
1-74. KINNAMOMINON
SUGGESTED: Cinnamominum, Cinnamomum zeylanicum 
— Oil of Cinnamon 
Cinnamominum is made from oil of balanine [1-40,
4-160] and thickened with xylobalsamum [1-18],
calamus [1-17], schoenus  [4-52], the sweetness of
cinnamon, carpo balsamum [1-18], four times the quantity
of myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116] as cinnamon, and honey is
mixed in to incorporate them. The best approved is not
sharp, with a mild smell and with myrrh predominating,
 75
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

thick and sweet-smelling, and with a very bitter taste.
This has its thickness not from resin but from myrrh. For
resin neither gives it bitterness nor a sweet smell. It is
sharp, warming and bitter. Therefore it opens the mouths 
of blood vessels by warming, and it dissolves, dissipates,
and draws forth all fluids and windiness, but it offends
the head. It is good for diseases around the vulva with
twice as much oil and wax and bone marrow, for this way 
it reduces much of its sharpness and becomes softening.
Otherwise it burns and h ardens more violently than all
other thickened ointments. It is effective with cardamom
for fistulas, decaying flesh, watery lungs, carbuncles
[infected boils] and gangrene; and rubbed on for chills
which recur, tremors, and those bitten by virulent beasts.
It is to be applied with bruised green figs to those touched 
by scorpions or phalangii [harvest spiders]. 
1-75. NARDINON MURON
SUGGESTED:  Phu germanicum, Valeriana vulgaris, 
Phu vulgare [Fuchs], Valeriana sylvestris major [Bauhin],
Valeriana officinalis [Linnaeus], Nardinum 
— Valerian [Mabberley] — Spikenard Ointment 
Nardinum ointment is prepared various ways —
either with the leaf of malabathrum [1-11] or without
it. For the most part it is mixed with oil balanine [1-40,
4-160] or unripe olive oil, and to thicken the oil juncus
odoratus [4-52, 1-16] is added, and to give it a sweet smell
costus [1-15], amomum [1-14], nardus [1-6, 1-7, 1-8, 1-10]
myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116] and balsamum [1-18] are added.
The best is thin, not sharp, with the sweet smell in it of
dried nardus or amomum. It reduces the intensity of
symptoms and purifies fluids with a sharp, cleansing,
warming strength. It is moist and not thick like a stalk or
stem, unless it has resin in it. Some with less value is made 
from unripe olive oil, juncus odoratus, calamus [1-17], costus 
and nardus. 
 76
OINTMENTS 

1-76. MALABATHRINON
SUGGESTED: Trapa bicornis — Ling Nut
Trapa bispinosa — Singhara Nut 
Trapa quadrispinosa — Water Chestnut species
Limnantheum indicum, Nymphoides indica — Water Snowflake
 Callitriche palustris, Callitriche verna, Callitriche platycarpa 
— Water Starwort
see 1-11
Malabathrinum or foliatum that is thickened like
nardinum [1-75] has more myrrh, thus it is warming 
and equal to crocinum [1-64] or amaracinum [1-68].
1-77. IASMELAION
SUGGESTED: Jasminum sambac,  Nyctanthes arbor tristus
[Bedevian] — Arabian Jasmine 
Jasme — Oil of Jasmine 
That which is called jasme is made among the Persians
from the white flowers of jasmine — two ounces of
which are placed into an Italian pint of sesame oil, then
changed and softened again as described in the
manufacture of liliaceum [1-62]. The use of this is
entertained among the Persians at their banquets for the
sweet scent that it yields. It is good for the whole body
after bathing, for those who want warmth and relaxation. 
It has a heavy sweet smell, so that many do not willingly
use it.

GUMS from TREES 
1-77. SMURNA
SUGGESTED: Commiphora myrrha — Myrrh Tree, Myrrha 
 Commiphora abyssinica — Coarse Myrrha
see 1-73
Smyrna [myrrh] is the oozing of a tree (like the
Egyptian [tree]) which grows in Arabia, an incision
being made in the thorns, from which the gum drips
down onto the mats spread underneath, but some
congeals around the stock of the tree. Some of this is
called pediasimos (as we should say, campestris) from
which when pressed stacte [oil of new myrrh] is taken.
Another called gabirea is more thick and grows in fruitful
and fertile places. It also yields much stacte. Priority is
given to that called troglodytica from the place that breeds
it — a pale green, biting and transparent. Some is also
gathered which is thinner, next in esteem to the
primitive, soft like bdellium, with a poisonous smell as it
were, growing in sunny places. There is another kind
called caucalis which is smelly, black and dried. The worst
of all is that which is called ergasima which is rough,with
little fat, and sharp — resembling gum both in sight and
strength. That called aminea is also not allowed. Fragrant
and fat pressings are made from the fat gum; pressings
neither fat nor good-smelling from the dry gum, weaker
because they did not take in oil in their manufacture or
forming. It is counterfeited by gum steeped in the water
in which myrrh was infused and mixed. Choose that
which is new, brittle, light, of the same colour
throughout, and which when broken is smooth like a nail 
and in small pieces — bitter, sharp, fragrant and
warming. That which is ponderous, weighs heavy and is
the colour of pitch is useless. 
It is warming, rheum-closing, sleep-inducing,
retaining, drying and astringent. It soothes and opens the 
closed vulva, and it expels the menstrual flow and birth
speedily applied with wormwood [3-26], a dilution of
lupins [2-132, 2-13] or juice from rue [3-52, 3-53, 4-98]. The
amount of a bean is taken like a catapotium [pill], against a
long-enduring cough, asthma, pains of the side and
 78
GUMS from TREES 

chest, looseness of the bowels and dysentery. It dissolves
chills (in acute fevers, especially recurrent paroxysmic
ones) the amount of a bean taken in a drink with pepper
and water two hours before the fit. Put under the tongue
and melted it helps both sharpness of the arteries and
hoarseness of the voice. It kills worms and is chewed for
stinking breath. For sores on the armpits it is rubbed on
with liquid alum [5-123]. Used as a mouthwash with wine 
and oil it strengthens teeth and gums. Rubbed on with
the flesh of a snail it cures broken ears and exposed
bones, as well as pus in the ears and their inflammation
with meconium [4-65], castorium [2-26] and glaucium [2-212, 
3-100]. It is rubbed on varicose veins with cassia and
honey. It cleans away impetigo [ skin infection] with
vinegar, and it stops hair falling out [alopecia] rubbed on
with ladanum [1-128], wine and oil myrsinum [1-48].
Rubbed on the ear externally it alleviates long-enduring
discharges. It fills up ulcers in the eyes, and it wears off
white spots on the cornea and things which darken the
pupils. It also smooths rough skin. A soot is also made of it 
(like soot of frankincense) effective for the same
purposes, as we will show. 
1-78. BOIOTIKE SMURNA
SUGGESTED: Hipposelinum,Smyrnium olusatrum, 
Petroselinum alexandrinum — Alexanders, Black Lovage,
Horse Parsley, Boeotin Myrrh 
see 1-77, 1-73, 3-78, 4-116
Boeotican myrrh comes out of the cut root of a certain
plant growing in Boeotia. Choose that which
resembles myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116] in the sweet smell. It is 
softening, warming and dissolving. It is also effective
mixed in inhalations of smoke or fumes. 
1-79. STURAX
SUGGESTED: Styrax officinale — Styrax Tree 
Styrax benzoin, Benzoin officinale, Lithocarpus benzoin
— Gum Benjamin Tree, Benzoe 
Styrax is the oozing of a certain tree like a quince tree.
The best is yellow, fat, full of resin, having white
 81
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

under the clots, which remains a long time in its sweet
sauce, and which when it is softened releases a certain
honeyish kind of moisture. The gabalites, pissiadicus and
the cilicius are like this. That which is black, brittle and
like bran (or encrusted) is worthless. An oozing like the
gum is also found (transparent like myrrh [1-77, 1-73,
4-116]) but there is only a little that grows of this. They
counterfeit it with powder from the same tree (made by
the boring of worms) by mixing honey with it and the
thick matter of iris and certain other things. Some also
aromatise wax or tallow in the sharpest sun, work it
together with styrax, and press it out into cold water
through a colander with broad holes (making as it were
little worms of it), and they sell it, calling it vermiculatum
[now a name for gum of acacia thorns]. Those who are
unskilful approve of it as authentic, not noticing the weak 
intensity of the smell, for that which is without deceit is
very sharp. 
It is warming, softening and digestive. It cures coughs 
and dripping mucus, runny noses, hoarseness and loss of 
the voice. It is good for closures and hardness in the
vulva, and taken as a drink and applied it dries out the
menstrual flow. It gently softens the bowels if a little of it
is swallowed down with resin terminthos [1-91]. It is also
effective mixed with dispersing ointments or plasters and 
acopon [fatigue removers]. It is burned, roasted, scorched
and made into a soot like thus [1-81] and this soot is good
for the same things as thus. But the ointment styracinum
[also refered to as oil of crocus] which is made from it in
Syria warms and powerfully softens; but it causes pain,
heaviness of the head and sleep.
1-80. BDELLION
SUGGESTED: Bdellium africanum, Balsamodendrum africanum,
Heudelotia africanum — Bdellium Tree, Balsamodendron kua 
Bdellium (which some call madelcum or bolchum) is the
oozing of a Sarandenian tree. The best-approved is
bitter in taste, transparent, fat like bull’s glue, fat in the
inside of it and easily growing soft, without wood or
other filth, with a very sweet smell when burnt, like
juncus odoratus [4-52, 1-16]. There is another sort — filthy
and black, in bigger pieces, rolled up into lumps —
 82
GUMS from TREES 

brought out of India. It is also brought from a town called
Petra, and this is dry, resinous, black and blue
underneath, and next in strength to the first. It is
counterfeited by mixing gum with it, but this is not as
bitter to the taste, and when burnt and smoked it does
not smell as sweet. 
It is warming and softening, and diluted with the
spittle of one fasting it dissolves hardness and swellings
of the throat and watery ruptures. It opens the entrance
to the vulva when applied and the smoke inhaled. It is an
abortifacient and draws out moisture. Taken as a drink it
breaks up stones [kidney, urinary] and it expels urine. It
is effective given for coughs and poisonous creatures'
bites. It is good for hernia, convulsions and pain of the
side, and for the accumulated wind in those who have
run. It is put into warm compresses which are good for
hardness and the knots in the nerves. Bruised, it is
worked together with wine or hot water is poured on it. 
1-81. LIBANON THUS
SUGGESTED: Boswellia carterii, Boswellia papyrifera, 
Boswellia floribunda, Boswellia serrata 
— Gum from Frankincense, Olibanum Tree 
 Ferula rubricaulis — also used in incense
Thus (which is also called  thurifera) grows in Arabia,
the best of which is the  masculum called stagonias,
naturally round. This when not cut is white, and when
broken fat within. Put on fire it burns straight. The Indian 
is both yellow-brown underneath and a pale yellow in
colour. It is made round by art and industry. For cutting it 
into cubes and throwing them into jars of clay they roll
them up and down so long in there until they take a
round form. Such thus as this grows yellow in time and is
called atomum or syagrium. Next to this is that from Arabia
and that which grows in Amelum. It is also called
copiscum [abundant] and it is smaller and more yellow.
There is some called amomites which is otherwise white
but when softened is yielding like mastic [1-51]. All thus is
adulterated with resin of pine and gum, being artificially
handled. Discerning this is easy. The gum when put into
a fire does not flame out, and the resin evaporates into
smoke, but the thus is kindled and by its scent proves
 85
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

itself.  It is able to warm and is an astringent to clean away 
things which darken the pupils, fill up the hollowness of
ulcers and draw them to a scar, and to glue together
bloody wounds; and it is able to suppress all excessive
discharges of blood including that of the neural
membrane. Pounded into small pieces and applied with
linen dipped in milk it lessens malignant ulcers around
the perineum and other parts. It takes away new warts
and impetigo [skin infection] smeared on with vinegar
and pitch. It cures ulcerous burns from fire and chilblains  
rubbed on with fat from a pig or goose. With saltpetre
[potassium nitrate] it cures ulcers that penetrate the
head. It is used with honey for hangnails and with pitch
for bruises of the ears, and poured in with sweet wine for
other sores of the ears. Rubbed on with fuller's earth
[ammonium silicate] and rosaceum [1-53] it is good for
women’s breasts inflamed from the time of their giving
birth. It is effective mixed with medicines made for the
arteries and the bowels; and taken as a drink it helps
those who spit blood. Taken as a drink by those who are
healthy it brings madness, and taken as a drink in any
great amount with wine, it kills. Thus is burnt in a clean
ceramic jar and set on fire by a piece of it lighted by a
candle until it is burnt. You must (after it is fully burnt)
stop it with something until it is quenched, for so it will
not be turned into ashes. Some also put a hollow brass jar
around the pot with holes in the middle for receiving the
soot, as we will show in the description of the soot of thus. 
Some place it into unfired jars, wrap it around with clay,
and burn it in a furnace. It is also burnt in a new ceramic
jar with hot burning coals until it no longer bubbles nor
sends out any more fat or vapour, and that which is
thoroughly burnt is easily broken.
1-82. PHLOIOS LIBANOU
SUGGESTED: Boswellia carterii, Boswellia papyrifera,
 Boswellia floribunda, Boswellia serrata —  Bark of Frankincense, 
Olibanum Tree 
The best bark of thuris [thus] is thick, fat, fragrant, new,
smooth, and neither coarse nor thin. It is
counterfeited by mixing it with the bark of strobilinum [fir
cones, pine cones]. Fire will also betray these. For the
 86
GUMS from TREES 

others when put into the fire do not kindle, but smoke
without any sweet smell and are extinguished. But the
bark of thus kindles and incense is made of it. It has the
same properties as frankincense but is more effective and
astringent. As a result, it is better (taken in a drink) for
those who spit blood or are troubled with an excessive
discharge from stomach or uterus; and as an astringent it
is alternately a substitute. It is also good for scars on the
eye, intestinal worms and filth, and applied it is effective
for scabby inflammation of the eyes.
1-83. LIBANOU MANNA
 SUGGESTED: Boswellia carterii, Boswellia papyrifera,
 Boswellia floribunda, Boswellia serrata 
—  Exudation of Frankincense,  Olibanum Tree 
Manna — an exudation
The approved manna of frankincense is white, clean
and grainy. It has the same strength as frankincense
but is somewhat grainy. Some adulterate it by mixing
with it resin from the pine tree, sieved, and the flour
used, or else bark of thus pounded. But fire tests all these
for they do not burn the same way, neither with the same
strength nor with the same clear airy smoke (as the other) 
but with a sooty and impure one, and the sweet smell has
a certain kind of sour one mixed with it.
1-84. LIBANOU AITHALIE
SUGGESTED: Boswellia serrata, Thus — Soot of Frankincense, 
 Spruce, Firs, Pines
Make soot of thuris as follows. Holding a grain of thus
[frankincense] with a little pair of tongs to a lamp
to set it alight, put it into a new hollow ceramic jar then
cover it with a brass jar (hollow within, full of holes in the
middle and carefully wiped very clean). Then put over
on one side of it (or on both) little stones of four fingers in
height to see whether the pieces burn or not, and that
there may be a place where to put other grains under also
before the first grain is quite out. Do this until you think
that you have gathered enough soot. But always keep the 
outside of the brass cover moist with a sponge dipped in
 87
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

cold water. For all the soot adheres faster to it when it is
not too hot, which otherwise because of the lightness of it
falls off and is mixed with the ashes of frankincense.
Therefore, having scraped off the first soot do so again as
often as you shall think suitable, and also take away the
ashes separately from the thus that has been burnt. It has
the ability to soothe inflammation of the eyes, repress
discharges, clean ulcers, fill hollow sores, and repress
diseases of the cornea.
1-85. LIGNUOS SKEUASIA
SUGGESTED: Soot of Myrrh — Commiphora myrrha 
Resin — Spruce, Firs, Pines; Benzoin — Styrax 
In the same way soot is made from myrrh [1-77, 1-73,
4-116], rosin and styrax [1-79] and these are good for
the same purposes [as the above]. You can produce soot
in the same way from other resins. 
1-86. PITUS, PEUKE
SUGGESTED: Pinus rigida, Peuce [Pliny] — Pitch Pine 
Pin, Pinus, Pinus pinea, Pinus sativa — Italian Stone Pine 
Pitys is a well-known tree. There is another similar tree  
called peuce which differs in shape. The bark of both
of them is astringent. Pounded into small pieces and a
poultice then made of it, it is good with sediment [of
wine] and manna [exudation of trees] for chafing
dermatitis, superficial ulcers and for burns. Taken with
myrica wax ointment it brings boils to a scar in those with
tender skin; and pounded into small pieces with blacking 
from a shoemaker it represses serpentia [?snakebite]. It
expels the birth and afterbirth out of the uterus taken as
inhalations (smoke, fumes); and taken as a drink it stops
discharges of the intestines and encourages urine. Their
leaves pounded into small pieces and made into a
poultice lessen inflammation and keep wounds from
being inflamed. Pounded into small pieces and boiled in
vinegar they lessen toothache when [the teeth are]
washed with the warm liquid. One teaspoon of the leaves  
(taken as a drink with water, or honey and water) is good
for liver disorders. The bark from the cones and the split
 88
GUMS from TREES 

leaves (taken in a drink) are good for the same purposes.
A toeda [a piece of the heart of the tree] cut in small pieces
in a decoction boiled with vinegar and held in to a tooth
that suffers, lessens toothache. A paste is made from
them suitable for preparations for enemas and
suppositories. When they are burning a soot is taken,
good to make writing ink, and good also to be put in
medicines for the eyelids. It is also good for erosions at
the corners of the eyes, weeping eyes and bald eyelids.
1-87. PITUIDES
SUGGESTED: Pinus rigida, Peuce — Pitch Pine 
 Pinus mughus,  Pinus nigra, Pinus maritima — Pineseeds, Pine
Pityides are the fruit of the pines [and of the pinus picea] 
found in the cones. They are astringent and
somewhat warming. They help coughs and disorders of
the chest taken either by themselves or with honey.
1-88. STROBILOI
SUGGESTED: Pinus mughus, Pinus nigra, 
Pinus maritima, Pinus pinea, Pinus rigida — Pine Cones 
Fir cones cleaned and eaten or taken in a drink with
passum [raisin wine] and cucumber seed are diuretic,
and dull irritations of the bladder and kidneys. They also
lessen rosiones [gnawing corrosion] of the stomach. Taken 
with juice of purslane [4-169] they strengthen infirmity of 
the body, and dull the infection of fluids. Fir cones
gathered whole from the trees, pounded while they are
fresh, and boiled in passum [raisin wine] are good for old
coughs and consumptive wasting if three cups of this
liquid is taken every day.

SUGGESTED: Schinus molle, Pistacia lentiscus,
 Bursera gummifera,  Sideroxylon mastichodendron, Schinus
 — Mastic Tree, Pepper Tree, Herb Mastic 
Schinus molle is now an American genus; Bursera gummifera is now a West Indian tree 
[Loudon].
Schinus is a well-known tree that is wholly astringent
in its fruit and leaves. The bark of the branches and
root are of equal strength. A juice is made of the bark, root 
and leaves sufficiently boiled in water. Then (after they
are boiled) the plant material is removed and the water
boiled again to the consistency of honey. Being of an
astringent nature it is good taken as a drink for throwing-
up blood, discharges from the stomach, and dysentery, as 
well as for bloody eruptions from the uterus, and for
prolapse of the uterus and perineum. Generally it may be
used instead of acacia and hypocistis [1-127]. The juice
strained out of the leaves performs the same functions,
and a decoction of the leaves applied with hot cloths fills
hollow cavities, consolidates broken bones, and stops
discharge of fluids from the uterus. It is a remedy against
gangrenous sores and is diuretic, and it settles unstable
teeth that are washed with it. The green sprigs are rubbed 
on the teeth (instead of reed toothpicks) to clean them.
An astringent oil is made from the fruit which is suitable
for things which need an astringent.
1-90. SCHININE RETINE
SUGGESTED: Schinus molle, Pistacia lentiscus,
 Bursera gummifera,  Sideroxylon mastichodendron, Schinus
 — Mastic Tree, Pepper Tree, Herb Mastic 
Schinus molle is now an American genus; Bursera gummifera is now a West Indian tree 
[Loudon].
A resin called lentiscina comes from lentiscum, and also
some called mastic. Taken as a drink it is good for
vomiting of blood and for an old cough. It is good for the
stomach, causing belching. It is mixed with tooth
powders and ointments for the face making it clearer. It
prevents the eyelashes from falling out and thickens
them, and when chewed it causes sweet breath and
 90

Schinus molle

strengthens the gums. The best and most abundant
grows in Chios and the choicest is that which is clear and
similar in whiteness to Tyrrhenian wax — full, dry,
crumbly and sweet-smelling — but that which is green is
bad. It is adulterated by frankincense and resin of pine
cones being mixed with it. 
1-91. TERMINTHOS
SUGGESTED: Terminthinus, Termenteyne [old English],
Pistacia terebinthus  — Turpentine Tree
see also 1-50, 5-39
Terminthos is a well-known tree the leaves, fruit and
bark of which are astringent and good for the same
things as lentisk [1-90], used and taken in the same way.
The fruit is edible but hurts the stomach. It is diuretic and
warming, excellent to act on venereal diseases. Taken in a 
drink with wine it is good against harvest spider bites.
The resin is brought out of Arabia Petraea. It also grows in 
Judaea, Syria, Cyprus and Africa, and in the islands called 
Cyclades. The preferred resin is most clear, white, a
glassy colour and inclining to an azure [blue], fragrant,
and smells like terminthos. The resin from terminthos
surpasses all other resins and after it is the lentiscina [1-90]
then pituine [1-86] and elaterium [4-155]. After these are
reckoned both peucedanum [3-92] and pine cones. Now all
resin has a soothing, warming, dispersing, cleansing
quality; good for coughs and consumption [ wasting
disease] taken in syrups (either by itself or with honey),
purging what should be purged out of the chest. It is also
diuretic, helps digestion, softens the intestines, and is
good for retaining hair on the eyebrows. It is good for
leprosy with rust from brass, blacking from a shoemaker
and saltpetre [potassium nitrate]. For ears which run
with filthy matter it is applied with oil and honey, and it
is effective for itching genitals. It is mixed with plasters,
warm compresses, and remedies to remove fatigue.
Rubbed on or applied by itself it helps pains of the side.

SUGGESTED: Pinus mughus, Pinus nigra, Pinus maritima,
 Pinus pinea, Pinus rigida, Peuce — Pitch Pine, Pine 
 Picea alba,  Pinus sylvestris, Abies pectinata, Picea excelsa
— White Spruce, Silver Fir, Fir
 Abies laryx, Larix europa — Larch 
Cupressus sempervirens, Cupressus funebris — Cypress 
Moist resin also comes out of the pine tree and the
pitch tree brought from Gallia and Hetruria.
Previously it was sometimes brought from Colophon
from which it had its surname of colophonia, as well as
from Galatia (which is near the Alps) which the
inhabitants of that place in their proper tongue call the
larch tree. This is particularly good (taken in a linctus
[syrup] or alone) for lasting coughs. They are also
different in colour for one is white, another of oil colour,
and another looks like honey, such as that of the larch
tree. Moist resin also comes out of the cypress tree, good
for the same purposes. Of that which is dry there is some
called strobilina [from pine cones], elaterium [4-155],
peucine [1-86] and pituine [1-86]. Choose that which smells 
sweetest and is clear — neither too dry nor too moist, but
like wax and brittle. Of these that of the pitch tree and fir
tree excel, for they have a sweet smell and resemble
frankincense in their odour. The best are brought out of
Pityusa (an island which lies near Spain), but that from
the pitch tree, strobilus [pine cones] and the cypress are of
a meaner sort and are not the same in strength as the
others, yet they are made use of for the same purposes.
Lentiscina [1-90] matches terminthos [1-91] in strength.
1-93. LIGNUOS RETINES
SUGGESTED: Soot from Resin 
All liquid resin is burnt in a jar containing four times
as much resin as the amount of the liquid that is to be 
poured into it. You must (when you have put four and a
half litres of resin and two gallons of rain water into a jar)
boil it over a coal fire gently, always stirring it until it is
without any smell and brittle and dry, and as it were
yields to the fingers. At last having cooled it, it must be
 94
GUMS from TREES 

put up in a bottle made without pitch, and so it becomes
extraordinarily white, but first you must strain all the
resin, melting it so that the filth may be separated from it.
It is also burnt without water on coals — gently at first but 
more violently when it begins to thicken — then place
many coals under and boil it without intermission for
three days and three nights until the remains have the
predicted properties. Then (as it is said) bottle and store
it. It is enough to boil the dry resin for one whole day and
then store it. When thus burnt these are good to give a
sweet smell to warm compresses and remedies to remove 
fatigue, as well as to colour ointments. Soot is also taken
from resins as well as thus [1-81] which is good mixed
with medicines to make the eyelids pleasing, for gnawed- 
around eye corners, for the membranes of the eyelids,
and for weeping eyes. Ink with which to write is also
made from it.
1-94. PISSA UGRA
SUGGESTED: Pinus mughus, Pinus nigra, Pinus maritima,
 Pinus pinea, Pinus rigida, Peuce — Pitch Pine
Pix liquida  (also called conum) is gathered from the
fattest wood of the pitch and pine trees. They reckon
the best is glittering, smooth and clean. A wine cupful
(taken with honey in a linctus [syrup]) is good in
antidotes for poisoning, pulmonary consumption
[wasting disease], purulent abnormal growths, coughs,
asthma, and fluids that are difficult to cough up from the
chest. It is good rubbed on with rosaceum [1-53] for
inflammation of the tonsils and uvula, as well as for
angina [spasmodic pains] and purulent [pus-filled] ears.
For snakebite it is applied with salt (ground fine). Mixed
with the same amount of wax it draws off pitted nails,
and dissolves tubercles [ growths] on the vulva and
hardness on the perineum. Boiled with barley meal and
the urine of a boy it breaks up tumours [possibly goitre].
Rubbed on with sulphur, pine bark or bran it stops
snakebite ulcers. Mixed with manna of thus [1-81] and
waxy ointments and rubbed on it heals twisting ulcers,
and is good for split feet and a split perineum, and with
honey it fills up ulcers and cleans them. With raisins of
 97
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

the sun and honey it covers carbuncles [infected boils]
[malignant skin tumours] and rotten ulcers with scars. It
is also effective mixed with antiseptic plasters. 
1-95. PISSELAION
SUGGESTED: Pinus mughus, Pinus nigra, Pinus maritima,
 Pinus pinea, Pinus rigida, Peuce — Pitch Pine
Picinum is made from the watery matter of pitch which 
swims on top (like whey on milk that has been
separated). This is taken away while boiling the pitch by
laying clean wool over it which is made moist by the
steam ascending up. It is squeezed out into a jar and this
is done for as long as the pitch is boiling. It is available for
the same purposes as liquid pitch. Applied as a poultice
with barley meal it restores hair fallen out from alopecia
[baldness]. Liquid pitch also cures the same, and rubbed
on them it cures boils and scabs on cattle. 
1-96. LIGNUOS UGRAS PISSES
SUGGESTED: Pinus mughus, Pinus nigra, Pinus maritima,
 Pinus pinea, Pinus rigida, Peuce — Pitch Pine
Soot is made from moist pitch. Light a new lamp, put a
portion of pitch into it and cover the lamp with a new
ceramic jar made like a clibinus (above round and narrow
and with a mouth below like ovens have) and let the
lamp burn. When the first liquid pitch is used up put in
more until you have made enough soot, and then use it. It 
is sharp and astringent and is used in medicines to make
the eyelids pleasing, for rubbing, and when hair must be
restored to eyelids that are filled with excessive watery
fluids. It is good for weak, weeping, ulcerated eyes. 
1-97. PISSA XERA
SUGGESTED: Pinus mughus, Pinus nigra, Pinus maritima,
 Pinus pinea, Pinus rigida, Peuce — Pitch Pine
Dry pitch is made from decocted liquid pitch. It is also 
called palimpissa (that is, pitch boiled again). Some
of this (called boscas) is sticky like birdlime, and another
 98
GUMS from TREES 

sort is dry. The good dry pitch is pure, fat, smells good,
and is golden underneath and resinous — such as the
Lycian and Brutian which share the two natures of pitch
and resin. It is warming and softening, removing pus,
dispersing tubercula [ nodules] and pannus [opaque
thickening of cornea with veins], and filling up ulcers. It
is effective mixed with wound medicines. 
1-98. ZOPISSA
SUGGESTED: Resin scraped off ships — Zopissa
Some call the resin (which together with wax is
scraped off ships) zopissa, and others call it  apochyma
as it is soluble because it was steeped in sea water. Some
have called the resin of the pine tree by the same name. 
1-99. ASPHALTOS
SUGGESTED: Bitumen — Asphalt — Mineral Pitch [1]
Judean bitumen is better than others. The best shines
and is purple and heavy with a strong scent, but the
black foul bitumen is worthless for it is adulterated with
added pitch. It is found in Phoenicia, Sidon, Babylon and
Zacynthus. It is also found (moist) swimming on wells in
the country of the Agrigentines (Sicily) which they use
for lamps instead of oil, and which they falsely call
Sicilian oil, for it is a kind of moist bitumen. 
1-100. PISSASPHALTOS
SUGGESTED: Pissasphaltos — Bitumen — Asphalt 
— Mineral Pitch [2]
There is some called pissasphaltos found in Apollonia
near Epidamnus, which is carried down from the
Ceraunian mountains by the violence of the river and
cast on the shore, growing into knobs which smell of
pitch mixed with bitumen. 
 99
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

1-101. NAPHTHA
SUGGESTED: Naptha — Bitumen — Asphalt — Mineral Pitch
[3]
There is also some called naptha, which is strained
Babylonian asphaltus, white in colour. Some is also
found which is black. It attracts fire because it draws it to
itself from a distance. It is good for bathing eyes and for
white spots on the cornea. 
Properties of Asphaltos
All bitumen is able to repress inflammation, close
open cuts and sores, and disperse and soften, and is
effective for congested vulvae and prolapse when
applied, smelled, or the smoke inhaled. Furthermore, it
reveals those troubled with epilepsy if the smoke is
inhaled like [burning] gagate [jet] stone. Taken as a drink
with wine and castoreum [2-26] it draws out the menstrual 
flow. It helps obstinate coughs, and those troubled with
asthma and difficult breathing, also snakebites, hip pains
and pains of the side. It is given to those troubled with
colic as a catapotium [pill], and taken as a drink with
vinegar it dissolves clots of blood. It is given melted with
barley water as a suppository to those troubled with
dysentery. It cures dripping mucus if inhaled. Wrapped
around teeth it soothes toothache. Dry bitumen warmed
with a continuous splashing (and so applied) retains hair. 
A plaster of it is applied mixed with barley meal, wax and
saltpetre [potassium nitrate] to help those troubled with
podagra [gout], arthritis and lethargy. Pissasphaltos can do
as much as pix [organic pitch] and bitumen mixed
together. 
1-102. KUPARISSOS
SUGGESTED: Cupressus sempervirens — Cypress 
 Cupressus funebris — Mourning Cypress, Weeping Cypress,
Funereal Cypress 
The leaves of cypress bind and cool. Taken as a drink
with passum [raisin wine] and a little myrrh [1-77,
1-73, 4-116] they help frequent painful urination. Pills of it 
(bruised and taken as a drink with wine) are good for
 100
GUMS from TREES 

bloody vomit, dysentery, excessive discharges from the
bowels, asthma and coughs. A decoction of it does the
same. Pounded with figs it soothes hardness, and cures
polyps [protruding growths from mucus membrane] in
the nostrils. Boiled with vinegar and pounded into small
pieces with lupins [2-132] it draws off rotten nails. A
poultice of it applied stops rupture of the intestines
[hernia] and the leaves do the same. Pills of it (together
with the filaments) placed smoking like a perfume
[incense] are an insect repellant to drive away mosquitos.
The leaves pounded into small pieces and applied as a
poultice heal wounds. It also staunches blood. Pounded
into small pieces with vinegar it dyes hair. It is applied as
a poultice either by itself or with polenta for erysipela
[streptococcal skin infection], herpes [viral skin infection],
carbuncles [infected boils] [malignant skin tumours] and
inflammation of the eyes. Mixed with a stiff ointment and 
applied it strengthens the stomach.
1-103.  ARKEOTHOS MEGALE,
ARKEOTHOS MIKRA
SUGGESTED: Iuniperos minor [Fuchs, Brunfels]
Juniperos vulgaris fructiosa [Bauhin], Juniperus excelsa
— Greek Juniper
Arceuthinus [Latin], Juniperus communis — Juniper 
POISONOUS — WOOD
Some juniper is bigger, some smaller. Either of the
junipers [the bigger and the smaller] are sharp,
diuretic and warming, and when burned the fumes drive
away snakes. One type of the fruit (called the juniper
berry) is the size of a hazelnut, the other equal to a bean
— both round and fragrant, sweet, and a little bitter to
chew. It is mildly warming and astringent, good for the
stomach, good taken in drink for infirmities of the chest,
coughs, gaseousness, griping, and the poisons of
venomous creatures. It is also diuretic; as a result it is
good for convulsions and hernia, and those who have
congested or blocked wombs. 
It has sharp leaves, as a result applied as a plaster and
taken as a drink (or the juice taken with wine) they are
good for those bitten by vipers. The bark (burned and
rubbed on with water) removes leprosy, but the scraping

or dust of the wood (swallowed down) kills. There is a
great juniper too, which some call cypressus sylvestris ,
some mnesitheus, some acatera, and the Romans juniperus,
and it is known to most like cypress growing for the most
part in rough places and near the sea. It has the same
properties as the former. The lesser juniper some call
archeuthis, some, mnesitheus, others, acatalis, the Africans
zuorinsipet, the Egyptians libium, the Romans juniperus,
and the Gauls jupicellusum.
1-104. BRATHUS 
SUGGESTED: Sabina [Fuchs], Sabina folio tamarasci Dioscoridis
[Bauhin], Brathys, Brathus [Latin], Juniperus sabina [Linnaeus],
Herba sabina — Savin, Sabin
There are two kinds of savin. One has leaves like
cypress, but is more prickly with a strong smell, and
sharp with a hot nature. The tree is short and extends
itself mostly in breadth. Some use the leaves for perfume.
The other kind has leaves like myrica [1-116]. Applied as a
poultice the leaves of either of them close stomas
[openings] and alleviate inflammation. Similarly, applied 
as a plaster with honey, they take away all blackness and
foulness, and they break up carbuncles [infected boils].
Taken as a drink with wine (as well as applied or by
inhalation) they draw out blood through the urine, and
drive out the birth. They are mixed with hot ointments
and in particular with gleucinum [1-67]. Some call it
barathrum, some baryton, and the Romans call it  herba
sabina.
1-105. KEDROS, KEDROS MIKRA
SUGGESTED: Cedrus libani, Cedrus libanotica, Pinus cedrus,
 Abies cedrus, Larix cedrus — Cedar of Lebanon 
Cedar deodara, Larix deodara, Pina deodara — Deodar,
Himalayan Cedar, Indian Cedar
POISONOUS
The cedar is a great tree from which cedria [oil of cedar] 
is gathered. It has fruit like the cypress but much
bigger. There is another tree called cedar which is less
 102
GUMS from TREES 

prickly than juniper, bearing round fruit as big as myrtle
berries. The best cedria is thick and very clear with a
strong scent; poured out it falls by drops and is not
diffused. It is able to decay living bodies and is a
preservative of dead ones; as a result some have called it
the life of the dead. It corrupts cloths and skin because it
heats and dries extraordinarily. It is also good for eye
medicines, clearing the sight when rubbed on. It takes
away white spots and scars on the cornea. Dropped in
with vinegar it kills worms in the ears; infused with a
decoction of hyssop [3-30] it quietens their noise and
hissing. Dropped into the cavities of teeth it breaks the
tooth but stops the pain. It does the same used as a
mouthwash with vinegar. Rubbed around the genitals
before sexual union it causes sterility. Those who are
troubled with angina are rubbed with it, and it helps
inflammation of pus-filled tonsils. Rubbed on it kills lice
and nits. A plaster of it applied with salt helps the bite of
the horned viper. It helps for poison of the sea hare [2-20]
taken in a drink with passum [raisin wine], and it helps
elephantiasis [skin disease]. As much as a wine cupful of
linctus [syrup] of it sipped (or the ointment applied) also
purges ulcers of the lungs and cures them. Taken as a
suppository it also kills ascaridae [threadworms] and
other worms, and it extracts the birth [abortifacient]. An
oil is made of the moisture which is separated from the
cedria [oil of cedar] by a fleece laid over it during boiling
(as we have said in the chapter on pitch) good for the
same purposes as cedria. Particularly the oil, strongly
rubbed in, cures scabs on beasts, dogs and oxen; and
when applied it kills ricinos [ lice], and heals ulcers on
those which came from shearing. The soot of it is
gathered like that of pitch, and it has the same strength.
The fruit of cedar is called cedrides. It is warming and bad 
for the stomach but helps coughs, convulsions, hernia
and slow painful urination. Taken as a drink with pepper
(pounded into small pieces), it dries out the menstrual
flow, and it is taken in wine against the poison of sea hare
[2-20]. Used with deer fat or bone marrow it repels snakes 
if the body is rubbed with it. It is also mixed in antidotes.

[Brunfels], Ruscus hypoglossum [Linnaeus], 
 Ruscus hippoglossum, Uvularia, Baslingua — Laurel of Caesar
[Mabberley], Horse Tongue, Double Tongue
Laurus nobilis — Sweet Bay, Laurel, Roman Laurel 
Some daphne [laurus] is found with a smaller leaf, some
a broader. Both are warming and softening, as a result 
a decoction of them is good as a hip bath for disorders of
the vulva and bladder. The green leaves are somewhat
astringent. Pounded into small pieces and applied they
are good for wasp and bee stings. Applied with barley
flour and bread they are able to lessen any inflammation.
Taken as a drink they make the stomach tender and
provoke vomit, but the bay berries heat more than the
leaves. They are good therefore taken in a linctus [syrup]
(after they are pounded into small pieces) with honey or
passum [raisin wine] for consumption [wasting disease],
asthma and dripping mucus around the chest. They are
also taken as a drink with wine against scorpion stings,
and they remove vitiligines [form of leprosy]. The juice of
the berries helps earache and hardness of hearing
dropped into the ears with old wine and rosaceum [1-53].
It is mixed with recipes for medicines to remove fatigue,
with hot ointments, and with those which disperse. The
bark of the root breaks stones [ kidney, urinary], is an
abortifacient, and is good for liver disorders — half a
teaspoon taken as a drink with fragrant wine. It is also
called danaben, stephanos (as we should say a crown),
daphnos, mythracice, mithrios, or hypoglossion. 
1-107. PLATANOS
SUGGESTED: Platanus orientalis — Oriental Plane 
The tender leaves of platanus (boiled in wine and
applied as a poultice) stop discharges of the eyes, and 
alleviate oedema and inflammation. The bark (boiled in
vinegar) is a lotion for toothache. The green filaments
(taken as a drink with wine) help those bitten by snakes.
Used in animal fat they cure burns. The down of the
leaves and filaments hurts the hearing and sight.

? POISONOUS
Melia is a well-known tree, the leaves of which (and
their juice) taken as a drink with wine (and applied 
as a poultice) help those bitten by vipers. The bark
burned and rubbed on with water removes leprosy; but
the thin membranous scales of the wood (taken in a
drink) are reported to be deadly.
1-109. LEUKE
SUGGESTED: Leucadendron argenteum, Myrtus leucadendron
 — Silver Tree 
Melaleuca leucadendron, Melaleuca cajputi — Punk Tree,
 Cajeput Oil Tree 
One ounce of the bark of the leuke tree (taken as a
drink) helps sciatica [pains in hips; sciatic nerves]
and slow painful urination. Taken as a drink with a
mule’s kidney it is reported to take away conception
[abortifacient]; and the leaves of it taken in a drink with
wine (after the menstrual flow) are said to do the same.
The lukewarm juice of the leaves is good dropped in the
ears for earache. The filaments which put out at the first
sprouting of the leaves, bruised small and rubbed on with 
honey, cure moisture of the eyes. Some say that the bark
of the white and the black leuke, cut into pieces of a small
size and scattered (or as it were sown) in beds that are
dunged, brings forth edible mushrooms at any time of
the year.

1-111. PTELEA
UNKNOWN
[modern usage] Ptelea trifoliata — Hop Tree, Shrubby Trefoil,
Wafer Ash [exotic]
The leaves, branches and bark of ptelea are all
astringent. The leaves, pounded into small pieces
with vinegar and so applied, are good for leprosy and
heal wounds; but especially the bark, if it is wrapped
around like a bandage, for it is flexible like a girdle. An
owner [?uncia - ounce] of the thicker bark (taken in a drink
with wine or cold water) expels phlegm. A decoction of
the leaves or bark of the roots, applied with hot cloths,
consolidates by drawing a callum [ hard skin] over the
fracture of a bone sooner. The moisture which is found in
the bladders [undeveloped fruit] at their first sprouting
clears the face when rubbed on it. The same moisture,
dried, is formed into little creatures like gnats. The newly- 
emerged leaves are used for sauce like vegetables. 
1-112. SAPROTES XYLON
SUGGESTED: Dry Rot
The rotten stuff like meal which is gathered out of old
wood and stocks of trees cleans ulcers and brings
them to scar when it is laid on them. It also stops serpentia

The leaves of aigeiros applied with vinegar help gouty
pains, and its resin is mixed with softening
medicines. The seed (taken as a drink with vinegar) is
good for epilepsy. It is also reported that the oozing
which trickles down from them near the river Padus
grows hard and becomes amber, called chrysophorum by
some. This yields a sweet smell when rubbed and looks
like gold. Ground finely and taken as a drink it stops
excessive discharges of the stomach and bowels.

Calamus rotang — Rattan Cane, Chair-bottom Cane
  Syringia vulgaris — Common Lilac, Pipe Tree
One kind of calamus from which arrows are made is
called nastos, the other is the female from which
bindings are made for the tibia [pipe or flute]. Another is
called syringias —  with much flesh [or pith], very knotty,
fit for writing books [paper]. Another is thick and hollow,
growing around rivers, called donax and cypria by some.
Another is called phragmites —  thin, inclined to
whiteness, known to all — whose root (bruised,
crumbled and applied either by itself or with bulbus
[2-200]) draws out splinters and thorns. It soothes limbs
that are out of joint, and pains of the loins [digestive or
procreative, lower torso] with vinegar. The green leaves
(pounded and applied) heal erysipela [streptococcal skin
infection] and other inflammations. The bark (burned
and applied with vinegar) cures alopecia [baldness]. The

SUGGESTED: Cyperus papyrus, Papyrus antiquorum — Papyrus,
Nile Papyrus, Paper Reed 
Papyrus from which paper is made is known to
everyone. It has particular use in medicine for
opening the mouth of fistulas [tubular ulcers]. It is
prepared (steeped in some liquid) and a linen thread tied
around it until it is dry. Straightened and put in the fistula
it is filled with moisture, and upon swelling it opens the
fistula. The root is somewhat nourishing. As a result the
Egyptians chew it, suck out the juice, and spit out that
which they have chewed. They also use it instead of
wood. Papyrus, burnt until it turns it into ashes, restrains
erosive ulcers in the mouth and other places, but burnt
paper does this better.

head, and for those bitten by phalangii [harvest spiders].
Applied as a poultice it stops oedema. The bark does the
same things, as well as the fruit. A decoction of the leaves
(taken as a drink with wine) melts the spleen, and
gargled in the mouth it helps toothache. For hip baths it is 
good for women troubled with a discharge of fluids from
the vulva, and a heated rub of it is good for those with lice 
and nits. Ash from the wood (applied) stops flows from
the uterus. There are some who make cups from the
wood which they use for those troubled with spleen (as
though the drink given them from such cups should do
them good).
1-117. EREIKA
SUGGESTED: Erice [Fuchs], Erica vulgaris glabra [Bauhin],
Calluna vulgaris [in Sprague] — Heath
Erica is a shrubby tree like myrica [1-116] (but a great
deal smaller) the flowers of which the bees use, but
they make honey with it that is not good. The leaves and
flowers applied as a poultice heal snakebites.
1-118. AKAKALIS 
UNKNOWN
Acacalis is the fruit of a shrub growing in Egypt,
similar to the fruit of the myrica [1-116]. A dilution of
it is mixed with eye medicines which are good for
sharpening the sight.
1-119. RAMNOS TRISSUS
SUGGESTED: Uva-crispa [Fuchs], Grossularia simplici acino,
Spinosa sylvestris [Bauhin], Ribes uva-crispa [Linnaeus],
Ribes grossularia [Mabberley] — Gooseberry
[other usage] Common Buckthorn, Purging Buckthorn 
— Rhamnus catharticus
Rhamnus is a shrub (growing around hedges) with
upright stems and sharp thorns like oxyacantha, and
the leaves are small, somewhat long, thick and soft. There 
 117
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

is another besides this that is paler, and a third having
darker and broader leaves, a little inclined to red; with
long stems of five feet and more, thorny, with its hairs
less strong and stiff. The fruit of it is broad, white and
thin, shaped like a little pouch or whorl.  The leaves of all
of them are effective rubbed on for erysipelas
[inflammatory skin disease] and herpes [ viral skin
infection]. It is said that the branches laid in gates or
windows drive away the enchantments of witches. [If
anyone picks up rhamnus  while the moon is decreasing
and holds it, it is effective against poison and mischief;
and it is good for beasts to carry it around them; and for it
to be put around ships; and it is good against headaches;
and against devils and their assaults.] 
It is also called persephonion, or leucacantha, the
Romans call it spina alba,  some, spina cerualis , and the
Africans call it atadin.
1-120. ALIMOS
SUGGESTED: Atriplex halimus, Chenopodium halimus 
— Sea Purslane, Sea Orach 
see 2-145
Halimus is a hedge-shrub like rhamnus [above] —
somewhat white, without filaments. The leaves
almost resemble those of the olive tree, yet they are
broader and more tender. It grows in maritime places
and hedges. The leaves are boiled like vegetables with
meat. One teaspoon of the root (taken as a drink with
honey and water) alleviates convulsions, hernias and
griping, and causes an abundance of milk [in
breastfeeding]. It is also called damassonium, erymon,
britannica, rabdion, a sort of little twig, basilion, or a sort of
regia. The Magi call it mercurii basis, or sapsis, some, osiridis
diadema, others, heliostephanon, a sort of corona of the sun
or sacer caulis. Pythagoras calls it  anthenoron, the
Egyptians, asontiri, some, asphe, asealuri, or asariphen, the
Romans, albucus, and some, ampelucia.

GUMS from TREES 

1-121. PALIOUROS
SUGGESTED: Paliurus aculeatus, Paliurus australis,
Paliurus spina-Christi, Rhamnus paliurus — Christ's Thorn,
Jerusalem Thorn, Garland Thorn 
Paliurus is a well-known shrub, prickly and strong.
The fat seed is found blackened with fungus. Taken
in a drink it helps coughs, breaks stones [urinary] in the
bladder, and is good for the stings of snakes. The leaves
and root are therefore astringent; a decoction of them
(taken as a drink) regulates the bowels, draws out urine,
and is good against poison and the bites of venomous
beasts. The root pounded into small pieces and applied as 
a plaster dissolves all new tubercula [nodules] and oedema.
1-122. OXUAKANTHA
SUGGESTED: Oxyacantha, Berberis [Fuchs], 
Berberis dumetorum [Bauhin], Berberis vulgaris [Linnaeus] 
— Barberry
[other usage] Lac Sumach — Rhus oxyacantha
Hawthorn, White Thorn, May Bush, Quick
 — Crataegus oxyacantha
Oxyacantha is a tree like a wild pear tree, but smaller
and very prickly. It bears a fruit like myrtle —  full,
red, easily broken — with a kernel within, and a deep
root divided into many parts. 
Taken in a drink or eaten, the fruit stops stomach
outflows and the flows of women. The root bruised small
and applied draws out splinters and thorns. It is said that
the root is able to cause abortions, the stomach being
touched gently with it or rubbed with it. It is also called
pyrina, or pytyanthe.
1-123. KUNOSBATON
SUGGESTED: Rubus caninus, Cynobatus, Rosa canina 
— Dog Rose, Hiprose, Canker Flower, Dog Briar 
Cynosbatus [dogs’ bush] (also called oxyacantha) is a
shrub much bigger than a common bush — almost
the size of a tree. It bears leaves a great deal broader than
 121
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

myrtle, and has strong hairs around the sprigs, white
flowers, and somewhat long fruit like the kernel of the
olive. When this is ripe it grows red and the stuff within is 
downy. The dried fruit stops discharges from the
intestines (the downy stuff of it is taken out for this is
worthless for the arteries). It is made hot in wine and
taken as a drink. 
1-124. KUPROS 
SUGGESTED: Cyprus, Cypre, Lawsonia inermis, Lawsonia alba 
— Henna, Egyptian Privet
Cyprus is a tree with leaves on the sprigs like the olive,
but broader, softer and greener; the flowers white
and mossy with a sweet smell, and the seed black like the
fruit of sambucus [4-174]. The best grows in Ascalon and
Canopus. The leaves are astringent, as a result they are
chewed to help ulcers in the mouth, and applied as a
poultice they cure all other hot inflammations and
carbuncles [malignant tumours]. A decoction of them is
used as a warm pack for those burnt by fire. The leaves,
pounded into small pieces, are steeped in the juice of
struthium [2-193] and rubbed on to dye the hair yellow.
The flowers (pounded into small pieces and applied the
forehead with vinegar) cause headaches to cease. The
ointment cyprinum [1-65] that is prepared from it
becomes heating and softens the tendons. It has a sweet
smell which it adds to hot medicines when it is mixed
with them.
1-123. PHILLUREA
SUGGESTED: Phillyrea latifolia — Mock Privet, Jasmine Box 
Phillyrea is a tree like cyprus [1-124] in size. Its leaves are 
like those of the olive tree but broader and darker. It
has fruit like the lentisk [1-90] — black, somewhat sweet,
lying in bunches like grapes. It grows in rough places.
The leaves are astringent like those of the wild olive
[1-37], effective for things that need astringency
especially ulcers in the mouth, either chewed or the sores
washed with a decoction of it. Taken as a drink it draws
out urine and the menstrual flow.

1-126. KUSTOS ARREN, KUSTOS
THELUS
SUGGESTED: Cistus ellipticus, Helianthemum chamaecistus,
Helianthemum vulgare — Common Rockrose, Sunrose
Cistus creticus, Cistus vulgaris, Cistus polymorphus
— Cretan Rockrose 
Cistus (also called cistharon or cissaron) is a shrub
which grows in rocky places. It has many low
branches full of round, black, rough leaves. The flowers
of the male are like the pomegranate, but the female are
white. It has an astringent quality; as a result the flowers
(pounded into small pieces and taken as a drink twice a
day in sharp wine) are good for dysentery. Applied as a
poultice by themselves they stop gangrenous ulceration
of the cheeks, and with a stiff ointment they heal burns
and old ulcers.
1-127. UPOKUSTIS, UPOKISTIS ETERA
SUGGESTED: Cytinus hypocistis — Hypocistis 
parasitic plant — contains gallic acid
Hypocistis grows around the roots of the cistus [rock
roses] like cytinus on the pomegranate. Some of it is
yellow, some green, some white. It is juiced like acacia,
but some dry and break it, then steep and boil it, and do
other things to it in the same way as lycium [1-132]. It is
similar in strength to acacia, yet more astringent and
drying — good for those troubled with colic, dysentery,
blood-spitting, or women's excessive discharges — taken
either as a drink or infused.  It is called robethrum, or
cytinus by some. The Africans call it phyllesade. 
1-128. LADANON
SUGGESTED: Ladanum, Labdanum, Cistus ladaniferus, 
Cistus creticus — Gum Cistus, Ladanum Resin Tree 
 Cistus ledon — Many-flavoured Gum Cistus
There is also another kind of cistus, called ledum by
some. It is a shrub growing in the same way as cistus,
 125
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

but it has longer, darker leaves, acquiring some fat in the
spring. The strength of the leaves is astringent, doing all
the things that cistus does. That which we call ladanum is
made from this plant. The he-goats and she-goats feed on 
the leaves of it and evidently carry away the fat from
them on their beards and thighs because it has a viscous
nature. This is taken off, strained, fashioned into little
balls and stored. Some draw little cords across the shrubs, 
take off the greasy matter that adheres to them and shape 
it. The best has a sweet smell, is somewhat green, easily
softened, fat, without sand — not foul and resinous such
as that growing in Cyprus — but the Arabic and Libyan
has less value. 
It is astringent, warming and softening, and opens
closely-touching [blood] vessels. It prevents hair falling
out [alopecia] mixed with wine, myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116]
and oil of myrtle. Rubbed on with wine it makes scars
look more handsome. It cures earache dropped in the
ears with honey water or rosaceum [1-53]. The smoke is
inhaled to expel the afterbirth, and mixed in a pessary it
cures hard lumps in the womb. It is effective in
pain-relievers, cough medicines and warm compresses.
Taken as a drink with old wine it stops discharges of the
bowels, and it is also diuretic. 
1-129. EBENOS
SUGGESTED: Diospyros ebenum — Ceylon Ebony
Ebenus cretica, Anthyllis cretica — Cretan Silver Bush 
The Ethiopian ebenus [ebony] is best — black, without
veins, as smooth as a horn that has been polished —
which shows thick [close or compact] when broken,
biting to the taste and gently astringent. Laid on coals
and burnt like incense it yields a sweet smell without
smoke. That which is new when put on fire is quickly
kindled because of its fat, and it turns somewhat yellow
on a whetstone. There is another (called Indian) with
streaks of white and yellow running between as well as
many spots. But the former is better. Some sell the wood
of sesame and acanthus (because they are somewhat
similar) as ebenus. They are known by this: — they are
hollow like a sponge, and are formed into small pieces
inclining to a purple colour with nothing biting in the
 126
GUMS from TREES 

taste nor sweet-smelling when burnt. Ebenus cleans away
things which darken the pupils of the eyes, and it is good
for old discharges and pustules. If anyone makes a
grinding pad of it, and uses it to rub eye salves or
suppositories on they will work better. It is made into eye
medicines: the scrapings or dust from it steeped in Chian
[from Scios in the Aegean sea] wine for a day and a night,
then carefully pounded and converted into eye salves or
suppositories. Some beat it first, then sift it and proceed
in the same way. Some use water instead of wine. It is also 
burnt in a new ceramic jar until it becomes coals, and is
then washed like burnt lead [5-96]. This is good for
itching eyes and dry inflammation of the eyes. 
1-130. RHODON 
SUGGESTED: Rosa, Rosa hortensis et sylvestris [Fuchs],
Rosa rubra [Bauhin], Rosa gallica [Linnaeus] 
— Common Rose, French Rose 
Rodon [roses] cool and are astringent, and dried roses
are more astringent. The juice must be pressed out of 
them whilst they are still young, first cutting off that
which is called the nail (which is the white that is in the
petal), and the rest must be pounded and pounded in the
shade in a mortar until it becomes thick, and then put in
jars for eye salves or suppositories. The leaves are also
dried in the shade. They must be turned over now and
then least otherwise they putrefy or grow mouldy.  Dried 
roses (boiled in wine and strained) are good for
headaches, as well as the eyes, ears and gums, and pain of 
the perineum, intestine, rectum and vulva, applied with
a feather or washed with the liquid. The same (without
straining) bruised, boiled and applied, are good for
inflammation of the area below the ribs, moistness of the
stomach and erysipela [streptococcal skin infection]. Roses 
(dried and pounded into small pieces) are sprinkled on
the thighs. They are put in compositions called antherae
[medicines extracted from flowers] and in wound
antidotes. They are burnt for medicines to make the
eyelids look pleasing. The part of the flower that is found
in the middle of the roses (dried and sprinkled on) is
good for gum discharges. The heads [hips] (taken in a
drink) stop loose intestines and blood-spitting.

1-131. RHODIDES 
SUGGESTED: Rhodides, Rosa, Rosa hortensis, Rosa sylvestris
[Fuchs], Rosa rubra [Bauhin], Rosa gallica [Linnaeus] 
— Pomanders of Roses, Common Rose, French Rose 
Pomanders of roses (which they call rhodides) are made 
in the following way. Take forty teaspoonfuls of
fresh roses (which are beginning to fade) before they
have absorbed any moisture, ten teaspoonfuls of Indian
nard [1-6] and six teaspoonfuls of myrrh [1-77, 1-73,
4-116]. These are pounded into small pieces and made
into little balls the size of half a teaspoonful, dried in the
shade, and stored in a jar made without pitch, tightly
corked all around. Some also add two teaspoons of costus
[1-15] and as much Illyrian iris, also mixing in Chian
[from Scios in the Aegean sea] wine with honey.  This is
used around women’s necks instead of necklaces, dulling 
the unsavoury smell of sweat. They use the same
(pounded into small pieces) in medicines made to repress 
sweat, and in ointments to rub on after bathing; and
when they have dried on the skin they are washed off
with cold water. 
1-132. LUKION
SUGGESTED: Lycium europaeum — European Box Thorn 
Lycium lanceolatum, Rhamnus infectorius [Matthiolus] 
— Spear-leaved Box Thorn 
Lycium (also called pyxacantha) is a thorny tree with
stems of three feet or longer around which the leaves
grow thickly, similar to box. It has a black fruit similar to
pepper — bitter, thick, smooth; a pale bark also similar
when moistened, and many winding and woody roots. It
grows abundantly in Cappadocia, Lycia and many other
places. It loves rough places. The juice is drawn out of the
leaves and shrubby stuff, pounded together and steeped
for many days. Then it is boiled, the woody matter of it
removed, and the liquid boiled again until it becomes the
consistency of honey. It is counterfeited by the sediment
of oil being mixed with it when boiled, or the juice of
wormwood [3-26], or an ox gall. The froth which swims
on top during boiling is taken off and bottled for eye
 130
GUMS from TREES 

medicines, but the rest is used for other purposes.
Similarly, juice is made from the fruit pressed out and left
in the sun. The best lycium takes fire and as it is quenched
has a red foam. It is outwardly black but when it is cut
yellow, without a stinking smell, astringent with
bitterness, the colour of saffron — such as the Indian
which is better than the rest and more effective. It is
astringent and removes things that darken the pupils. It
heals scabs on the eyelids, their itching and old
discharges. Rubbed on it is good for pus-filled ears,
tonsils, ulcerous gums, chapped lips, cracks in the
perineum, and affritus [ chafing] of the perineum. It is
good for those troubled with colic and dysentery either
taken as a drink or given as a suppository. It is given in
water to those who spit-up blood, and those troubled
with coughs, and is swallowed down like pills or taken as
a drink with water for one bitten by a mad dog. It makes
hair look yellow. It heals hangnails, whitlows, shingles
and putrefying ulcers. It stops the menstrual flows of
women. It helps those bitten by mad beasts, taken as a
drink with milk or swallowed down like pills. 
It is said that the Indian lycium is made of a shrub
called lonchitis [3-161, 3-162]. But it is a kind of thorn that
has many upright stems, three feet long or more, growing 
out of the bottom, thicker than the bush, the broken bark
looking red but the leaves similar to those of the olive
tree. Boiled in vinegar and taken as a drink it is said to
cure inflammation of the spleen and sickness of the head,
and to expel women’s flows. Given raw (pounded into
small pieces) and taken in a drink it is said to have a
similar effect. One half-wineglass of the seed (taken in
drink) purges out watery matter, and is an antidote
against deadly medicines.
1-133. AKAKIA
SUGGESTED: Acacia, Akakia, Acacia senegal, Acacia arabica,
 Acacia nilotica, Mimosa arabica, Acacia gummifera,
 Mimosa gummifera, Acacia stenocarpia — Gum Arabic
 Acacia catechu, Mimosa catechu, Mimosa catechoides
— Black Cutch, Kutch [Catcho or Kat 16th century]
Acacia grows in Egypt. It is a thornbush with many
branches, growing almost to the size of a tree. It does 
 133
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

not grow upright; it has a white flower, and the fruit lies
in pods like lupin [2-132]. From this a juice is pressed out
and dried in the shade. It looks black if it is made of the
ripe fruit, but a pale yellow if it is made of the unripe.
Choose that which is a little yellow, sweet-smelling, as far 
as is fit in acacia. Some juice the leaves together with the
fruit. There is also a gum that comes out of this thorn
which is astringent and cooling. The juice is good for eye
diseases, erysipela [streptococcal skin infection], creeping
sores, chilblains, pterygium [membrane on eye], ulcers of
the mouth, and falling [sunken] eyes. It stops the flows of
women as well as prolapse of the vulva. It is therapeutic
for the bowels taken as a drink or a suppository, and it
dyes hair black. Pounded with water it is a wash for eye
diseases. That which coalesces is then poured out (until
the water remains clean) and is made up into little balls. It 
is burnt in an unfired clay jar in a furnace until the jar
itself is thoroughly burned. It is burnt on coals, the fire
kept kindled with bellows. A decoction of the thorns
closes together loose joints applied with hot cloths. The
gum of the thorns is the best — which is vermiculatum  —
resembling glass, transparent, not woody; next to this is
the white gum; but that which is resinous and foul is
useless. It is able to close pores and dull the strength of
sharp medicines with which it is mixed. Daubed on with
an egg it does not allow burns to break out into pustules. 
Another acacia grows in Cappadocia and Pontus,
similar to the Egyptian but a great deal smaller, growing
low and being more tender, surrounded crosswise with
filaments, and having leaves similar to rue [3-52, 3-53]. In
the autumn it bears seed somewhat smaller than lentil, in
pods joined together each containing three or four seeds
apiece. The juice of this (drawn out of the whole plant) is
therapeutic for the bowels, but is of less strength and
useless in eye medicines. 
1-134. AMORGE
SUGGESTED: Amurca — Sediment of Olive Oil 
Amurca is the sediment of oil which has been pressed
out and boiled in a jar made of Cyprian brass until it
is the consistency of honey. It is therapeutic for the
bowels, and rubbed on with wine, vinegar, or honeyed
 134
GUMS from TREES 

wine is as effective as lycium [1-132] for toothaches and
wounds. It is mixed with medicines that are good for the
eyes and for closing pores. Growing old it becomes better. 
Taken as an infusion it is good for the perineum, the
genitals, and ulcerated vulvas. It extracts spoiled teeth,
boiled to the consistency of honey with unripe olive oil
and smeared around them. It heals scabs on beasts
[veterinary] rubbed on with a decoction of lupins [2-132]
and chamaeleon [3-10, 3-11]. Used without boiling and
new in a warm pack it assists those troubled with gout in
their feet and joints. Put onto a fleece and applied on
those who have dropsy it represses the swelling.
1-135. AGNOS 
SUGGESTED: Vitex agnus-castus — Agnus Castus, Hemp Tree,
Chaste-tree
Agnus [vitex] is a shrub almost as high as a tree  bearing 
long sprigs, growing near and in watery fields and
in rough and uneven places. It is hard to break and the
leaves are similar to those of the olive tree yet more
tender and bigger. Some of them bear white flowers
inclining to purple, others purple flowers; and the seed is
like that of pepper. It is warming and astringent and the
fruit (taken as a drink) helps those stung by snakes, the
splenetic, and those with dropsy. A teaspoonful (taken as
a drink in wine) brings down milk [breastfeeding] and
expels the menstrual flow. It destroys generation [birth
control] and is rubbed on the head bringing on a deep
sleep. A decoction of the herb and seed is good as a hip
bath for disorders and inflammation around the womb.
The seed (taken in a drink with pulegium [3-36], or the
smoke inhaled or applied) causes purgation. It dissolves
headaches applied as a poultice, and is gently poured on
the lethargic and mentally ill with vinegar and oil. The
leaves either smoked and inhaled or scattered around
drive away venomous creatures, and applied as a
poultice they help those stung by such beasts. Applied
with butter and vine leaves they soothe hardness of the
testes [old English: ovaries]. The seeds smeared on with
water lessen cracks in the perineum, and with the leaves
it heals dislocated joints and wounds. It is thought to be a
preventative for chafing and blisters if anyone (as he
 137
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

travels) holds a rod of it in his hand. It is called agnus
because in the sacrifices to Ceres the chaste matrons used
it for sprinkling under them; and it is called lygos (that is,
vimen) because of the difficulty of breaking the stems. It is
also called agonon (as we should say, unfruitful or barren), 
or lygon, a sort of vimen [producing long flexible shoots],
amictomiaenon, or tridactylon; the Magi call it semnon, a sort 
of venerandum [to be respected]; it is also called sanguis
ibis, the Egyptians call it sum, the Romans, salix marina,
others call it piper agreste, and some, ligusticum. 
1-136. ITEA
SUGGESTED: Primum salicis genus, Alterum salicis genus [Fuchs], 
Salix purpurea, Salix vitellina, Salix repens [Linnaeus] 
— Creeping Willow [Mabberley]
[other usage] Itea ilicifolia, Itea virginica, Itea riparia
Itea is a tree known to all whose fruit, leaves, bark and
juice are astringent. The leaves pounded into small
pieces and taken in a drink with a little pepper and wine
help those troubled with iliaca passio [painful intestinal
obstruction]. Taken by themselves with water they cause
inconception [birth control]. The fruit (taken in a drink) is
good for those who spit blood, and the bark does the
same. Burnt and steeped in vinegar it takes away calluses
and corns, rubbed on them. The juice from the leaves and 
bark warmed with rosaceum [1-53] in a cup of malum
punicum [pomegranate] helps sores in the ears, and a
decoction of them is an excellent warm pack for gout. It
also cleans away scurf [eczema]. A juice is taken from it at
the time of its flowering, the bark being cut, for it is found
coalesced within. It has the ability to clean away things
that darken the pupils.

SUGGESTED: Olea europaea var oleaster — Wild Olive 
Elaeagnus angustifolia— Oleaster, Oil Tree,
 Zakkoum Oil Plant 
 Elaeis guineensis — Oil Palm 
Cotinus coggyria, Rhus cotinus — Venetian Sumach,
 Smoke Tree 
The wild olive tree (also called cotinon or the Ethiopian
olive tree) has leaves of an astringent nature which
— pounded into small pieces and so applied — are able to 
restrain erysipela [streptococcal skin infection], shingles
[herpes], epinyctis [pustules which appear only at night],
carbuncles [malignant tumours], gangrenous ulceration,
hangnails and whitlows; and (applied with honey) to
take away scabs. They clean foul ulcers and dispel pain
and inflammation. Applied with honey they retain skin
that was torn on the head. They also heal ulcers in the
mouth and apthae [ thrush in children or candidiasis]
when chewed. Their juice and a decoction of them does
the same. The juice applied stops eruption of the blood,
the flows of women, staphylomata [inflammatory
protrusion of the cornea] in the eyes, and pustules [pus
under skin], as well as ulcers and old dripping fluids. As a
result put into eye salves they are good for ulcers of the
eyelids. To extract the juice you must beat the leaves into
small pieces and pour in wine or water, then strain it out,
and having dried it in the sun, make it up into little balls.
That which is strained out with wine is far stronger and
fitter to be kept in store than that which is strained out
with water. It is good for ulcerous ears that are full of
discharges. The leaves smeared on with barley meal are
good for coeliac [intestinal complaints]. The leaves (and
this serves instead of spodium, calcined powder) are burnt 
together with the flowers in an unfired clay jar the mouth 
of which must be well sealed until the jar is thoroughly
baked. Afterwards they are quenched with wine, then
kneaded together again with wine and burnt in the same
way. Afterwards they are washed like cerussa [white lead
ore] and made up into balls. It seems that burnt like this it
comes nothing short of spodium [calcined powder] for eye 
medicines; as a result it is to be considered of equal
strength.

1-138. ELAIA
SUGGESTED: Olea europaea — Olive 
The leaves of the cultivated olive are good for the same 
purposes but have less strength — as a result they are 
better for eye medicines because of their mildness. The
moisture which comes out of the burnt green wood
(rubbed on) heals dandruff, parasitic skin diseases and
lichen [papular skin disease]. The fruit applied as a
poultice heals dandruff and gangrenous ulceration of the 
cheeks. That which is within the kernel pulls off scabby
nails used with animal fat and corn meal.
1-139. ELAIA KOLUMBADES
SUGGESTED:  Olea europaea — Pickled Olives, Olive 
Pickled olives pounded into small pieces and applied
as a poultice will not allow burns to grow into
blisters, and they clean foul ulcers.The liquid of the brine
used as a mouthwash strengthens gums and loose teeth.
The olive which is pale yellow and new is worthless for
the intestines but good for the stomach. That which is
black and ripe is easily spoiled and bad for the stomach,
as well as hurtful to the eyes and a cause of headaches.
Roasted and applied as a poultice it prevents gangrenous
ulceration, and emarginates [removes the edge of]
carbuncles [infected boils] [malignant skin tumours]. 
1-140. AGRIELAIA ELAION
SUGGESTED: Olea europaea var oleaster — Wild Olive 
The oil of the wild olive is a mouth rinse for moist
rotten gums, and it settles loose teeth. A warm pack
of it warmed and used as a mouthwash is a suitable
medicine for rheumatic gums, but wool dipped into the
oil must be placed around the gums with an instrument
until they look white.

 Elaeis guineensis — Oil Palm 
Cotinus coggyria, Rhus cotinus — Venetian Sumach,

The third pressing of olive oil is also called tree oil.
The oozing of the Ethiopian olive tree in a way
resembles scammony. It is a deep yellow consisting
of little drops of a biting nature. That which is similar to
gum and ammoniacal — blackish, and not biting to the
taste — is useless. The olive tree and wild olive tree bear
such a gum as this. It is good for moisture of the sight, and 
rubbed on it cleans scars and white spots on the cornea of
the eyes. It induces the movement of urine and the
menstrual flow, and it is effective for toothache put into
the cavities. It is categorised among medicines that are
destructive, it expels the birth, and cures impetigo [skin
infection] and lepra [old use — psoriasis]. The wild olive
tree is also called the Ethiopian olive tree.
1-142. DRUS 
SUGGESTED: Quercus cum longo pediculo [Bauhin], 
Quercus robur [Linnaeus], Quercus pedunculata, 
Quercus sessiflora — Oak
Each part of the oak is astringent, but the film which
lies between the bark  and the stock (similar to that
under the cup of the acorn) is most therapeutic for the
bowels. A decoction of this is given for coeliac [intestinal
complaints], dysentery, and to blood-spitters, and
pounded into small pieces it is put into suppositories for
women troubled with excessive discharges of the womb.

 Quercus sessiflora, Quercus aegilops, Quercus cerris,
 Quercus coccifera — Acorns, Oak 
Quercus ilex, Quercus ballota — Holly Oak 
Quercus infectoria, Quercus lusitanica — Gall Oak, Dyer’s Oak,
Nut Gall Oak
Acorns produce the same effects as they are also
diuretic. Eaten as meat they cause headaches and
are wind-inducing, but also help poisonous bites. A
decoction of them and their bark (taken as a drink with
cows' milk) helps poisoning. The unripe ones pounded
into small pieces and applied as a poultice relieve
inflammation. With salted swines’ grease they are good
for malignant calluses and injurious ulcers. Those of the
ilex [holly oak — Quercus ilex] have greater strength than
those of the oak. 
1-144. PHEGOS, PRINOS
SUGGESTED: Fagus sylvatica — Common Beech,
 European Beech Tree 
[Pliny] Prinus, Quercus ballota — Holm Oak,
 Great Scarlet Oak 
The fagus of Virgil was the Quercus aesculus [Loudon].
Fegus and prinus, both a kind of oak, have similar
effects, and the bark of the root of prinus boiled in
water until it becomes tender and rotten and applied for
a whole night dyes the hair black. It is first made clean
with Cimolian earth [5-176]. The leaves of all of them
bruised and pounded into small pieces help oedema, and 
strengthen feeble parts.

Fagus castanea [Linnaeus], Castanea sativa, Castanea vesca,
Castanea vulgaris — Chestnut, Sweet Chestnut
The Sardian nuts (also called lopima, castana, mota or
Jupiter’s acorns) being astringent also have the same
effects [as other astringents], and especially the loose
skins between the flesh and the shell. The flesh is good
for those who drink ephemerum [4-85] [antidote].  
1-146. KEKIDES
SUGGESTED: Quercus lusitanica, Quercus infectoria
 — Dyer’s Oak, Gall Oak, Nut Gall Oak
Cecides [galla] is a fruit of the oak, of which some is
called omphacitis. It is little, knobby, heavy and
without a hole. Some is smooth and light and has a hole
in it, but the omphacitis ought to be chosen as it is the most
effective. Either of them is strongly astringent. Pounded
into small pieces they stop abnormal growths of the flesh, 
and stop discharges of the gums and the middle ear, as
well as ulcers of the mouth. That which is in the middle of 
them put into the cavities of teeth eases the pain. Laid on
hot coals until they are set on fire and quenched with
wine, vinegar, or brine made with vinegar they are able
to staunch blood. A decoction of them is good in hip
baths for a prolapsed uterus and for discharges. They
make the hair black steeped in vinegar or water. They are
good for coeliac [ intestinal complaints] and dysentery
pounded into small pieces and rubbed on, or taken as a
drink with wine or water, and also mixed with sauce, or
first boiled whole in water (with which you must boil
something else too, of things that are good for people).
Generally where there is need of an astringent, or to stop
or dry, you ought to make use of them. 
 149

1-147. ROUS
SUGGESTED: Rhus coriaria — Tanning Sumach 
Rhus (which is sprinkled among sauces and also called 
erythrum) is the fruit of rhus coriaria, which is called
this because tanners use it for thickening their hides. It is
a little tree which grows on rocks — two feet high, the
leaves somewhat long and red, jagged all around. The
fruit is like little bunches of grapes — thick, the size of
that of terminthos [1-91], and somewhat broad. That
which encloses the fruit is very useful. The leaves are
astringent and good for the same purposes as acacia. A
decoction dyes the hair black, and is a suppository for
dysentery. It is a liquid medicine, hip bath, and an
instillation for discharges of the ears. The leaves applied
as a poultice with vinegar or honey stop  pterygium
[membrane on the eye] and gangrene. The juice of the
dried leaves boiled with water to the consistency of
honey are as useful for as many things as lycium [1-132].
The fruit does the same things (being food) in mixing it
with meat for coeliac [ intestinal complaints] and
dysentery. Applied as a plaster with water it prevents
inflammation of fractures, desquamation or skin peeling,
and blueness of wounds. It cleans rough tongues with
honey. It prevents the excessive discharges called whites
[leucorrhoea — a mucosal vaginal discharge] and cures
haemorrhoids, applied with oak coals pounded into
small pieces. The boiled liquid of this fruit gathers a
cream that is better for these purposes than the fruit itself. 
It also leaves a gum which is put into the cavities of teeth
to take away their pain.

SUGGESTED: Poma, Phoenix dactylifera — Dates, Date Palm 
Phoenix sylvestris — Wild Palm 
The palm tree grows in Egypt. The fruit is gathered in
the autumn, the ripening time being half over. It is
similar to the Arabic myrobalan [1-40, 4-160] and it is called
poma. It is a green colour, and similar to cydonium [1-160]
in smell, but if it is left alone until it comes to the full
ripeness it becomes dates. It is sour and astringent and is
taken in a drink with hard wine for discharges from tooth 
sockets and the menstrual flows of women. It stops
haemorrhoids and glues wounds together if it is rubbed
on. Fresh dates are more astringent than dried. They
cause headaches and if eaten in too great an abundance
with meat they inebriate. Dried dates eaten with meat are 
good for blood-spitting, the stomach, and dysentery. It is
pounded into small pieces with cydonium [1-160] and the
waxy ointment oenanthinum [from vine shoots or
blossoms] and rubbed on for disorders of the bladder.
The caryotae [pips, seeds] heal roughness of the arteries if
eaten.
1-149. PHOINIKES THEBAIKAI
SUGGESTED: Hyphaene thebaica, Hyphaene coccifera,
 Coccifera thebaica, Corypha thebaica, Douma thebaica
— Doum Palm, Gingerbread Tree 
A drink of a decoction of the Thebaean palm relieves a 
fever’s burning heat, and taken with old honey
water it restores the strength. Eaten with meat it does the
same. A wine is also made of it that has the same strength
as the fruit. A decoction taken as a drink alone (and
gargled up and down as well) is strongly astringent. The
seeds of the dates are burnt in a new ceramic jar like all
others are, then quenched and washed in wine. They
serve well instead of spodium [calcined powder] to make
the eyelids pleasing, and if they are not sufficiently burnt
they must be burnt again. They are astringent and close

the pores, also being good for pustules in the eyes and
staphylomata [inflammatory protrusion of the cornea];
and for dripping fluids of the eyelids (some nard [1-6, 1-7, 
1-8, 1-10] being mixed with them). With wine they stop
abnormal growths of the flesh and bring ulcers to a scar.
The best seeds come out of Egypt from the low-growing
palms. 
1-150. PHOINIX ELATE
SUGGESTED: Palma, Elate, Spatha, Phoenix dactylifera 
— Palm, Coverings of Date Fruits, Date Palm 
 Borassus flabellifer — Palmyra Palm, Tal Palm,
 Great Fan Palm 
yields wine and sugar
Palma which is also called elate or spatha is the
enclosure [or cup] of the fruit of the date trees as yet
flourishing. The dealers in unguents [ ointments] use it
for thickening their ointments. The best is
sweet-smelling, astringent, heavy, enclosed, having that
within it fat. It is astringent for stopping feeding ulcers,
and it draws loose joints together if it is pounded into
small pieces and mixed together with warm compresses
and poultices. It is good for the thoracic area [ heart], a
stomach that is out of tune, and disorders of the liver,
mixed with poultices suitable for this purpose. A
decoction of it dyes the hair black if it is rubbed on it
repeatedly. Given in drink it is good for inflammation in
the kidneys, and disorders of the bladder and the bowels. 
It stops discharges of the intestines and a womb troubled
with an excessive discharge. Boiled whilst it is tender and
applied with rosin and wax for twenty days together it
cures psoriasis. The fruit which is contained inside is
called elate or borassus and that is also astringent and
produces the same effects as spatha [above], except that it
is not so good in ointments. The white marrow of the
stalk (eaten while it is new, or else boiled) is good for the
same things as borassus.

SUGGESTED: Punica granatum — Carthaginian Apple,
Pomegranate 
All sorts of pomegranates have a pleasant taste and
are good for the stomach, yet they do not nourish.
Of these the sweetest are best for the stomach, producing
some heat around the stomach, and are flatulent as a
result unsuitable for those with acute fever. That which is
sharp helps a burning stomach, is more contractive and
more diuretic, but tastes unpleasant to the mouth and is
astringent. That which tastes similar to wine has a middle 
strength. The kernel of the sharp one (dried in the sun
then sprinkled on meat and boiled together with it) stops
discharges of the intestines and excessive discharges
from the stomach. Steeped in rain water and taken as a
drink it helps blood-spitters, and is good in hip baths for
dysentery and the fluids of childbirth. The juice of the
kernels (pressed out, then boiled and mixed with honey)
is good for ulcers in the mouth, genitals and perineum;
also for pterygium [ membranes, webs] between the
fingers, gangrenous ulcers, abnormal growths in ulcers,
earache, and sores in the nostrils. This helps especially if
the juice is pressed out of the grains of sharp
pomegranates. 
1-152. KUTINOI
SUGGESTED: Cytini, Punica granatum
— calyx of Pomegranate Flowers 
The flowers of this (which are also called cytini) are
astringent, drying and restringent, and agglutinate
bloody wounds, being good for the same purposes as
pomegranates. A decoction makes a mouth rinse for
moist flagging gums and loose teeth, and it is put into
poultices as a glue for teeth which are broken, [to repair
the damage]. Some relate that whoever swallows down
three cytini (though ever so little) shall not be troubled
with eye sores all that year. They are juiced like hypocistis
[1-127].

SUGGESTED: Sidia, Punica granatum — Pomegranate Rinds 
The rinds of pomegranate (also called sidia) are also
astringent and good for the same purposes as  cytini
[pomegranate flowers]. A decoction of the roots expels
and kills worms hidden in the intestines. 
1-154. BALAUSTION
SUGGESTED: Balaustion [Bedevian], Punica protopunica
[Mabberley] — Wild Pomegranate Tree 
Balaustium is the flower of wild pomegranate of which
there are many kinds — some white, some red and
some a rosy colour. It is similar to cytini and is juiced in
the same way as hypocistis. It is astringent and good for
the same purposes as hypocistis and cytini [flowers of
pomegranate]. 
1-155. MURSINE
SUGGESTED: Myrtus communis var romana 
— Broad-leaved Myrtle 
[other usage]  Myrsine africana — African Myrsine 
see 4-146
The cultivated black myrtle is more effective for bodily 
uses than the white, and that which grows on the
hills is the best, yet it has the weakest fruit. The herb and
fruit are astringent. Both the green and dried fruit are
given to eat to those who spit blood, and to those
troubled with erosions of the bladder. The juice of green
myrtle pressed out has the same effect, being good for the 
stomach and diuretic. It is good with wine for the bites of
harvest spiders and one stung by a scorpion. A decoction
of the fruit dyes the hair. Boiled with wine and applied as
a poultice it heals ulcers that arise in the extremities of the 
body. Applied with flour of meal it lessens inflammation
in the eyes. It is rubbed on for ulcers in the inner angle of
the eye. The wine that is made from the fruit, pressed and 
boiled a little (for that which is not quickly grows sour)

and taken as a drink beforehand, prevents [the effects of]
excessive indulgence, and is good for the same things as
the fruit. In hip baths it is good for prolapse of the vulva
and perineum, and for women troubled with excessive
menstrual flows from the vulva. It cleans dandruff, scaly
eruptions of the hairy scalp and rashes such as measles,
and it prevents hair falling out.
It is mixed with gentle plasters (which they call liparas) 
as is the oil that is made from the leaves. Similarly a
decoction of the leaves is good for bathing joints that are
loosened, and joints which grow together with difficulty.
For fractures that grow together with difficulty it is
effective applied with hot cloths. It cleans vitiligines [form 
of leprosy]. It is dropped in to cure ears full of discharge,
and is used for blackening the hair, and the juice does the
same. The leaves themselves pounded into small pieces
and applied as a poultice with water are good for the
moisture of ulcers, all places subject to excessive
discharges, and for  coeliac [intestinal complaints]. Oil of
unripe olives or a little rosaceum [1-53] and wine mixed
together [with this] are good for shingles [ herpes],
erysipelas [febrile disease with skin inflammation],
inflammation of the testium [old use: ovaries], epinyctis
[pustules which appear only at night] and joints. The dry
leaves pounded into small pieces are effective scattered
on paronychiae [whitlows], pterygium [membranes, webs],
and on armpits and thighs that are moist, and it prevents
sweats from cardiandi [disease of the heart]. Burnt or else
used raw with stiff ointment they heal burns, pterygium
[membranes, webs] and paronychiae [ whitlows]. The
leaves are juiced by pouring old wine or rain water on
them and straining it out. It must be used newly-made for 
when old it putrefies and loses its strength. 
1-156. MURTIDANON
SUGGESTED: Myrtidanum — Fungal growth on Myrtle
Myrtidanum is that which grows on myrtle —
unequal and standing out, similar to a wart and
the same colour, similar to hands clasping around the
body of the myrtle. It is more therapeutic for the bowels
than myrtle. Bruised and mixed with hard wine and
made into pellets, it is dried in the shade and put in jars to

mixed with stiff ointments, suppositories, baths,
poultices, and anywhere there is need of an astringent.

SUGGESTED: Cerasus [Fuchs], Prunus cerasus, Cerasus vulgaris, 
Cerasus acida, Cerasus caproniana — Cherry
Cerasus avium, Prunus avium [Linnaeus] — Sour Cherry,
 Gean Cherry, Hedge Berry 
Cerasia that are eaten when fresh are good for the
intestines, and dried they stop discharges of the
bowels. The gum from cerasia heals an old cough taken
with diluted wine. It causes a good colour, sharpness of
sight and appetite. Taken in a drink with wine it is good
for those troubled with kidney stones. 
1-158. KERATIA
SUGGESTED: Ceratonia siliqua — Carob Tree, Locust Tree,
 St John's Bread
The pods (taken while they are fresh) are bad for the
stomach and loosen the intestines, but dried they
stop discharges of the bowels. They are also better for the
stomach and diuretic, especially combined with the
remains left after pressing out grapes.

The leaves, blossoms and sprigs of all sorts of melea
trees are astringent, especially those of the quince
tree. The unripe fruit is astringent, but if ripe it is not so.
Those apples which are ripe in the springtime encourage
bile, are hurtful to all that is sinewy, and are flatulent.

SUGGESTED: Cotonea malus, Cydonia [Fuchs], 
Mala cotonea minora [Bauhin], Pyrus cydonia [Linnaeus],
Cydonia oblonga, Cydonia vulgaris — Quince
Cydonia are good for the stomach and diuretic. If they
are roasted they become milder and good for
intestinal complaints and dysentery. Raw quinces are
especially good for those who spit up purulent matter
and for biliousness. The water in which these have been
steeped is good as a drink for those troubled with
excessive discharges from the stomach or bowels. The
juice of the raw ones is taken and is good for orthopnoea
[form of asthma], and a decoction is good in warm packs
for prolapse of the perineum and vulva. In honey (or
those preserved in honey) they are diuretic but the honey 
takes their strength and becomes astringent. Boiled with
honey they are good for the stomach and pleasant to taste 
but less astringent. The same raw fruit is put into plasters
to stop the bowels, as well as for churning and burning in
the stomach, inflamed breasts, spleens that have grown
hard, and for joints. Furthermore after they are well
pounded and pressed a wine is made from them, and so
that it may keep longer there is mixed with it one unit of
honey to sixteen units of juice or else it would go sour.
This is good for all the things previously specified. An
ointment is made of these called melinum which we use
when we need an astringent oil. You must choose out the
right quinces — small and round and with a good scent;
but those which are called struthia [ostrich-like] and are
big are less effective. The dried blossoms as well as the
fresh are suitable in plasters made for things that need an
astringent, and besides this they are good (taken in a
drink of wine) for inflammation of the eyes, bloody
vomiting, tooth sockets that discharge fluids, and attacks
mensium [monthly, menstrual problems].

that bears fruit throughout the whole year one under
another. The fruit itself is somewhat long, wrinkled,
resembling gold in colour, smelling sweet with
heaviness, with seed similar to a pear. Taken as a drink in
wine it is able to resist poisons and subducere [to draw off]
bowels. A decoction or the juice is a mouth rinse for sweet 
breath. It is especially eaten by women [as a remedy]
against their lusting [ anaphrodisiac]. The leaves are

Achras is a kind of wild pear which takes long to ripen.
It is more astringent than the pear, as a result it is

Coccymelia  is a known tree whose fruit is edible and
bad for the stomach, softening the bowels, especially 
fruit of those from Syria and those growing in Damascus.
Dried, it is good for the stomach and therapeutic for the
bowels. A decoction of the leaves (used or prepared in
wine and gargled) stops the excessive discharge that falls
on the uva [uvula], gingiva [gums] and tonsils. The fruit of
wild plums dried when it is ripe does the same. Boiled
with sapa [syruped new wine] it becomes better for the
stomach and more astringent to the bowels. The gum of
the plum tree closes open cuts and sores, and taken as a
drink with wine breaks kidney stones. Rubbed on with
vinegar it heals lichen [papular skin disease] on children.

The root of the bitter almond tree bruised and boiled
takes away spots on the face caused by sunburn, as

Applied to the forehead or temples with vinegar and
rosaceum [1-53] they drive out the menstrual flow and
help headaches. They are good with wine for epinyctides
[pustules which appear at night], rotten ulcers, and
shingles [herpes], and with honey for dog bites. Almonds
if eaten take away pains and soften the bowels, cause
sleep and are diuretic. They are good for bloody vomit
taken with amyl [starch] and mint. They are good for
inflamed kidneys and pneumonia taken as a drink with
water or as a linctus [syrup] with resina  terminthos [1-91].
Taken with passum [raisin wine] they help those troubled
with painful urination and urinary stones. They help

amount of a nut of the avellana [hazel] taken in a linctus
[syrup] with milk and honey. They keep away
drunkenness if five to seven of them are taken before
indulging. It kills foxes when they eat it with something
else. The gum of the tree is astringent and heats, and is
taken in drink as a remedy for bloody vomit. Rubbed on
with vinegar it takes away impetigo [skin infection] on the
surface of the skin. Taken in a drink with diluted wine it
cures old coughs, and it is good taken in a drink with
passum [raisin wine] for those troubled with urinary
stones. The sweet edible almond has a great deal less
strength than the bitter, yet that also reduces symptoms
and is diuretic. Green almonds eaten with their shells
heal moistness of the stomach.

SUGGESTED: Pistacia vera, Pistacia officinarum,
 Pistacia reticulata — Pistachio 
Pistacia grow in Syria and are similar to pine nuts.
They are good for the stomach chewed or else
pounded into small pieces. Taken as a drink in wine they
help those bitten by snakes.   
1-178. KARUA BASILIKA 
SUGGESTED: Juglans [Fuchs], Juglans regia [Linnaeus] 
— Walnut
native to Persia, recommended by Pliny as a vermifuge [Loudon]
Carya basilika which some call persica are hard to digest 
when eaten, hurt the stomach, produce bile, breed
headaches and are worthless for those who have a cough, 
but good to make one vomit if eaten while fasting. They
are antidotes against poisons eaten before or after, or
with figs and rue [3-52, 3-53, 4-98]. Eaten in a great
quantity they expel broadworms. They are laid on
inflamed breasts, suppurations and dislocations with a
little honey and rue. With onions and salt and honey they 
are good for those bitten by dogs or bitten by men. Burnt
together with their calyx and applied to the navel they
lessen griping. The putamen [seed vessels - woody part]
burnt and pounded in oil and wine and rubbed on the
heads of children is good to make the hair pleasing and
fills up alopecia [ baldness]. The kernel within is burnt,
pounded into small pieces, and applied with wine to stop 
the menstrual flow. The kernels of old caryae chewed and
then applied as a poultice cure gangrene, carbuncles
[infected boils] [malignant skin tumours], aegilopses [ulcer 
or fistula in the inner angle of the eye] and alopecias
[baldness] out of hand. An oil is made of them bruised
and pressed out. The green [or new ones] are sweeter and 
less hurtful to the stomach. As a result they are mixed
with garlic to take away the tartness of it. They take away
black and blue spots when applied.

SUGGESTED: Avellana domestica, Avellana-nux sylvestris, Corylus
[Fuchs], Corylus sativa, Corylus sylvestris [Bauhin],
Corylus maxima [in Sprague], Nux avellana, Corylus avellana
[Linnaeus], Nux pontica [Loudon] — Common Hazel
Carya Pontica (also called leptocarya [small carya]) are
worthless for the stomach, yet pounded into small
pieces and taken as a drink with honey and water they
cure old coughs. Roasted and eaten with a little pepper
they digest dripping fluids; and burnt whole, pounded
into small pieces with goose grease or bear grease, and
rubbed on they restore hair that has fallen out from
alopecia [ baldness]. Some say that the shells burnt and
pounded into small pieces together with oil make the
pupils of gray-eyed children black if the forepart of the
head is moistened with it. 
1-180. MOREA
SUGGESTED:  Morus nigra — Mulberry 
 Morinda umbellata, Morus indica — Indian Mulberry 
[other usage]  Morea sisrinchium [Loudon] — Spanish Nut 
Morus or sycaminus is a well-known tree. Its fruit
makes the intestines soluble. It is easily spoiled
and bad for the stomach and the juice is the same. Boiled
in a brass jar or left in the sun it is made more astringent.
A little honey mixed with it makes it good for the
discharge of fluids, for gangrenous ulceration of the
cheeks, and for inflamed tonsils. The strength of it is
increased if alumen [5-123] in small pieces, galls [oak],
myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116] and crocus are mixed with it as
well as the fruit of myrica [1-116], iris and frankincense.
Unripe mulberries dried and pounded are mixed with
sauces or rhus [1-147] and they help coeliac [ intestinal
complaints]. The bark from the root boiled in water and
taken as a drink loosens the bowels, expels broadworms
from the intestines, and is an antidote for those who have
taken aconitum [4-77, 4-78] as a drink. The leaves pounded 
into small pieces and applied with oil heal burns. Boiled
with rain water, wine and black fig leaves they dye the
hair. A wine cupful of juice from the leaves (taken as a
 177
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK
Morus alba

Morus nigra
after FAGUET — 1880

drink) helps those bitten by harvest spiders. A decoction
of the bark and leaves is a good rinse for toothache. It is
milked at harvest time, the roots dug around and cut-in.
The next day there will be found some coalesced gum
which is good for toothache, dissolves swellings, and
purges the bowels. There seem to be some wild
mulberries similar to (the fruit) of the bramble but more
astringent, the juice is less spoiled and good in warm
packs for inflammation, healing ulcerated jaws, and to fill 
up wounds with flesh. They grow in shady and cold
places. 
1-181. SUKOMORON
SUGGESTED: Sycomorus antiquorum, Ficus sycomorus 
— Sycamore Fig, Sycamore, Mulberry Fig 
[other usage] Sycamore [old English], Acer pseudoplatanus
— Maple, Bastard Sycamore, Sycamore Maple, Mock Plane
Sycamine — old English for Mulberry [see above]
Sycomorum is also called sycaminum and the fruit is
called sycomorum because of the faintness of its taste.
It is a great tree similar to a fig tree — very full of juice, the
leaves similar to the mulberry tree. It bears fruit twice or
four times a year, not from the highest (boughs) as on the
fig tree, but from the stock, similar to the wild fig —
sweeter than green figs but without grains, and not
growing ripe unless it is scratched with a nail or with
iron. It grows abundantly in Caria and Rhodes and places 
not very fertile for wheat. It helps in time of scarcity of
corn [ famine] by continually bearing fruit. The fruit is
good for the bowels, yields little nourishment, and is bad
for the stomach. The tree is milked at the beginning of
spring before it brings forth fruit, the outside of the bark
being broken with a stone, for if it is broken deeper in it
sends nothing forth. The oozing from it is gathered in a
sponge or fleece, then dried, formed (into little balls), and
stored in newly-made jars.  This juice is softening, closes
open cuts and sores from wounds, and dissolves growths
that ripen with difficulty. It is taken in a drink and also
rubbed on against the bites of snakes, spleens that have
grown hard, pains, and a cold stomach. This juice is
quickly spoiled with worms.

1-182. SUKON EN KUPRO
UNKNOWN
Atree grows in Cyprus that differs from these. It is an
elm [?ash] yet it has leaves similar to sycamine [1-180]
and fruit the size of prunes and sweeter. In all other
things it is similar to those mentioned above.
1-183. SUKA 
SUGGESTED: Ficus sativa [Fuchs], Ficus communis [Bauhin],
Ficus carica [Linnaeus] — Fig 
Ripe new syca are bad for the stomach and loosen the
intestines but the looseness that comes from them is
easily stopped. They bring out pimples and sweat,
quench thirst, and extinguish heat. The dried ones are
nourishing and warming, cause thirst, and are good for
the bowels. They are useless for discharges of the
stomach and intestines, but good for the throat, arteries,
bladder and kidneys, those who have a poor colour from
a long illness, as well as asthma, epilepsy and dropsy.
Boiled with hyssop [3-30] and taken as a drink they clean
away things in the chest. They are good for old coughs
and long-lasting disorders of the lungs; and pounded
together with saltpetre [potassium nitrate] and  cnicus
[4-119, 4-190] and eaten, they soften the bowels. A
decoction of them is good for inflammation around the
arteries and tonsils, used in a gargle. They are mixed in
poultices with barley meal, fenugreek or barley water for
women’s warm packs. Boiled with rue [3-52, 3-53, 4-98]
they are a suppository for griping. Boiled and afterwards
pounded into small pieces and applied, they dissolve
hard lumps and soften parotid tumours, boils and
inflammatory tumours. They ripen pannus [opaque
thickening of cornea with veins] more effectively with
iris, saltpetre [potassium nitrate] or quicklime [calcium
oxide — lime which has been burned but not yet slaked
with water]. Pounded raw with the things previously
specified they do the same. With pomegranate rind they
clean away pterygium [membrane on the eye], and with
calcanthum [limestone] they cure difficult, curable and
malignant discharges in the tibiae [hollow bones, marrow, 
 179
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

not only the tibia]. Boiled in wine and mixed with
wormwood [3-26] and barley meal they are good for
dropsy applied as a poultice. Burnt and put into a wax
ointment they cure chilblains. The raw ones pounded
into small pieces mixed with moist mustard and put into
the ears, cure noises and ringing in them. The (milky)
juice of both the wild and cultivated figs coagulates milk
like rennet, and dissolves coagulated milk like vinegar.
Taken as a drink with almonds that have been pounded
into small pieces it is able to make bodies break out into
boils, to open pores, loosen the bowels and relax the
womb. It expels the menstrual flow applied with the yolk
of an egg or Tyrrhenian [Etruscan] wax. It is good put
into poultices made for gout together with fenugreek
flowers and vinegar. With polenta it cleans leprosy, lichen
[papular skin disease], spots made by the heat of the sun,
vitiligines [form of leprosy], parasitical skin diseases, and
running sores on the head. Dropped on the sores it helps
those stung by scorpions, and strikes of poisonous beasts, 
and those bitten by dogs. Taken on wool and put into the
cavities of teeth it helps toothache. It takes away
formicosam [anthill-shaped] warts if it is rubbed on the
flesh with animal fat.
1-184. SUKE AGRIA 
SUGGESTED: Ficus carica var sylvestris — Wild Fig Tree 
 Ficus variegata, Ficus amboinensis, Ficus racemosa, 
Caprificus amboinensis — Getah Fig Tree, Wild Fig 
The juice of the tender leaves of the wild syca tree does
the same things. When they are great with child (not
yet fruiting) and the eye (bud) has not put out, they are
pounded and pressed out, and the juice is dried in the
shade and stored. Both the liquid and juice are taken for
the strength they have to raise [fill] ulcers. The sprigs of
this tree boiled with beef makes it boil quicker. They
make milk more loosening if they are used to stir it with
during boiling instead of a spatha [1-150]. 
 180

1-185. OLUNTHOI
SUGGESTED: Ficus carica — Unripe Figs 
Olyntha (some of which are called erinei) boiled and
applied as a poultice soften all nodules, scrofulous
tumours [ glandular swelling] and goitres. Applied raw
with saltpetre [potassium nitrate] and meal they take
away formicosam [anthill-shaped] warts and warty
abnormal growths. The leaves can do the same. Applied
as a poultice with vinegar and salt they heal running
ulcers on the head, dandruff and epinycti [pustules which
appear only at night]. Fig-like scabrous cheeks are rubbed 
with these. Vitiliginous [form of leprosy] white areas are
plastered with the leaves or branches of the black fig.
They are good also with honey for the bites of dogs, and
the ulcers called favi by the Latins but by the Greeks ceria
[honeycombed ulcers]. Grossi [unripe figs] with the
leaves of wild poppy draw out (broken) bones, and they
dissolve boils [inflammatory tumours] with wax. Applied 
with ervum [2-129, 2-131] and wine they are good against
the bites of rodents, spiders, centipedes and millipedes. 
1-186. KONIA SUKES
SUGGESTED:  Ficus carica var sylvestris — Wild Fig Tree 
 Ficus variegata, Ficus amboinensis, Ficus racemosa,
 Caprificus amboinensis — Getah Fig Tree, Wild Fig 
 Ficus carica — Fig 
Lye is made from ashes of the burnt branches of the
wild and cultivated syca trees. You must steep the
ashes long and often. It is good both for caustic medicines 
and gangrenous parts, for it cleans and removes things
which are superfluous. It must be used by moistening a
sponge in it often and immediately applying it. Give it to
some as a suppository for dysentery, old discharges, and
hollow, undermining, great ulcers. For it cleans, heals,
covers in flesh and closes together, similar to plasters
made for bloody wounds. It is given for clotting blood
together and against dripping fluids, hernia and
convulsions, newly strained-out with a wine cupful of
water and a little oil mixed in. By itself it helps coeliac
[intestinal] complaints and dysentery, the amount of a
 181
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

wine cupful given. It is a convenient ointment with oil for 
those troubled with sores of the tendons, and
convulsions that cause sweats. It is taken as an antidote in 
a drink for those who have swallowed gypsum [hydrous
calcium sulphate — plaster of Paris] and for the bites of
harvest spiders. The other sorts of lye have the same
effects (especially that of the oak) and they are all
astringent.
1-187. PERSEA
SUGGESTED: Persea, Mimusops schimperi  
— Egyptian Lebekbaum [Bedevian] 
Persea is a tree which grows in Egypt, especially in
Thebes. It bears fruit fit to eat and good for the
stomach, on which the spiders called cranocolopta are
found. The dry leaves pounded into small pieces and
applied are able to stop blood breaking out. Some have
reported that this tree when it grew in Persis was deadly,
but when transported into Egypt it was altered and
became good to eat.
1-188. IBERIS
SUGGESTED: Nasturtium agreste [Fuchs], Hiberis [Brunfels],
Nasturtium pratense [Bauhin], Cardamine praetensis [Linnaeus]
 Cardamine amara — Bitter Cress, Large Bitter Cress 
[other usage] Candytuft — Iberis numidica
Clown Mustard, Bitter Candytuft — Iberis amara
Iberis or cardamantica has leaves similar to nasturtium
[2-185], more flourishing in the spring, the length of it
as much as a foot or somewhat smaller. It grows in
untilled places. In the summer it puts out a milky flower
and then it is more effective. It has two roots similar to
nasturtium —  warming and caustic. They are good for
those diseased with sciatica if a poultice similar to a plaster 
is made of it with salted lard of a sow (and so applied and
let lie) for four hours. Afterward let the patient be put into 
a bath and rubbed on the places affected with oil and
wine dipped in wool.

In the first book, most loving Areius, that we made of
medicinal matters we have discoursed of aromata

gum and fruits that come of them. But in this being the
second book we shall come to discussion both of living
creatures and of honey and of milk and of animal fat and
of those things which they call frumentacea [cereals], as
well as pot herbs [vegetables], annexing for those such
herbs as are endowed with a sharp quality because such
are near of kin, as are garlic and onions and mustard seed,

LIVING CREATURES
2-1. ECHINOS THALASSIOS
 Echinus species — Sea Urchin 
Echinus from the sea is good for the stomach, good for
the intestines, and diuretic. The raw shell roasted
well should be mixed with washing medications made
for psoriasis. Burnt, it cleans foul ulcers and represses
abnormal growths on the flesh. 
2-2. ECHINOS CHERSAIOS
 Erinaceous genus — Hedgehog 
The burnt skin of the earth hedgehog is good for
alopecia [baldness] rubbed on with moist pitch. The
dried flesh (taken in a drink with honey or vinegar and
honey) helps inflamed kidneys, water under the skin
[dropsy], and those who have convulsions, elephantiasis,
or cachexy [ defective nutrition]. It dries up discharges
from the bowels and liver. Dried in a sun-dried clay jar,
and stored, then given, it does as much good for the same
things. 
2-3. HIPPOKAMPOS
 Hippocampus [Latin] — Sea Horse 
Hippocampus is a little living creature of the sea that is
burnt and the ashes used either in goose grease,
liquid pitch, or ointment amaracinum [1-68]. Rubbed on
it fills up alopecia [baldness] with hair. 
2-4. PORPHURA
SUGGESTED: Purpura
Shellfish - yields Tyrian purple dye.
Burnt purpura dry and clean teeth, repress excrescent
flesh, and draw boils and heal them.

2-5. KUREKES
SUGGESTED: Buccinum species — Whelks 
Burnt buccina do the same as the above but they are
more caustic by nature. If anyone fills them with salt
and burns them in an unfired clay jar they are good as
toothpastes and rubbed on burns. The medicine must be
left alone until it grows hard like a shell, for after the burn
is healed it falls off of its own accord. Quicklime is made
of them as we will show when we come to discuss calx.
2-6. IONIA
SUGGESTED: The columellae of Buccinae [Whelks] and Purpurae
Ionia are the middle parts in the buccinae and purpurae
around which they turn in or wind around. It is burnt
in the same way, but is more caustic than the buccinae and
purpurae because by nature they adhere less. The flesh of
the buccina has a good taste and is good for the stomach,
but does not soften the bowels.
2-7. MUAKES
SUGGESTED: Mytilacea species — Mussels 
The Pontic mytuli are best. When burnt their effect is
similar to the buccina but more peculiar. Washed like
lead they are good with honey for eye medicines as they
consume thickened areas, and clean away white spots on
the cornea and whatever else darkens the pupils. Their
flesh is effective applied to one bitten by a dog.
2-8. TELLINAI
SUGGESTED: Tellina, family Tellinidae — Tellen, bivalves
Tellinae whilst they are fresh and new are good for the
bowels, especially their broth. Seasoned with salt,
burnt, pounded into small pieces and dropped on with
cedria [1-105], they do not allow hairs on the eyelids to
spring up again after they are once plucked out.
 185

2-9. CHAMAI
SUGGESTED:  Chamae species — Chama, bivalve molluscs
The broth of chamae and other shellfish boiled in a little 
water stirs the bowels. It is taken with wine.
2-10. ONUX
SUGGESTED: Unionaceae, Onycha — Freshwater Mussels 
Onyx (or unguis) is the covering of a shellfish similar
to that of the purpura [shellfish] found in India in
the nardus-bearing lakes. As a result it smells sweet — the
shellfish feeding on the nardus. It is gathered after the
lakes are dried up by extreme drought. The best is
brought from the Red Sea. It is somewhat white and fat.
The Babylonian is black and smaller. Both of them (put
on coals) have a sweet smell somewhat resembling castor
[2-26] in scent. The inhaled smoke restores women
troubled with constrictions of the uterus, and those who
have falling sickness. Taken as a drink they trouble the
bowels. The burnt shellfish itself does the same things as
purpura and buccinum [above]. 
2-11. KOCHLIAS
SUGGESTED: Helix aspersa, Helix hortensis — Garden Snails 
Helix pomatia —  Snails, edible species
The earth snail is good for the stomach and spoiled
with difficulty. The best are in Sardinia, Africa,
Astypalaea, Sicily and Chios, as well as those in the Alps
near Liguria, surnamed pomatias (because of their
covering). The sea snail is also good for the stomach and
is easily transient, but the river snail is poisonous. The
field snail (called sesilon or seselita) that hangs on bushes
and shrubs troubles or disturbs the intestines and
stomach causing vomiting. The burnt shells of all of them
are able to heat and burn, and clean leprosy, vitiligines
[form of leprosy] and the teeth. Burnt whole with their
flesh, pounded into small pieces, and rubbed on with
honey they take away scars in the eyes, white spots on
the cornea, sunspots, and moisture of the sight. Applied
 186
LIVING CREATURES

raw with their shells they dry up dropsy tumours and do
not fall off until all the moisture is exhausted. They
soothe gouty inflammation and draw out thorns applied
in a similar way. Pounded into small pieces and so
applied they expel the menstrual flow. Their flesh
pounded into small pieces and applied as a poultice with
myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116] and frankincense heals wounds,
especially those around the tendons. Pounded into small
pieces with vinegar, they stop bleeding from the nostrils.
The live flesh (especially of the African snail), eaten,
pacifies pains of the stomach. Taken whole with the shell
and a little of it taken with a drink of wine and myrrh, it
cures those troubled with colic and pains of the bladder.
The earth-snail heals falling hair if one thrusts a needle
through the flesh of the snail and touches the hair with
the slimy matter that comes from there. 
2-12. KARKINOI
SUGGESTED: Cancer pagurus [Brachyura] — Crabs 
Two spoonfuls of ashes of burnt crevises or river crabs
with one spoonful of the root of gentian (taken as a
drink in wine for three days together) evidently helps
one bitten by a mad dog. With boiled honey they soothe
cracks in the feet and perineum, as well as chilblains and
diseases of the cornea. Pounded raw and taken as a drink
with an ass's milk they help snakebites, and the strikes of
harvest spiders and scorpions. Boiled and eaten with
their broth they are good for those in consumption
[wasting disease], and those who have swallowed a sea
hare [2-20]. Pounded together with basil and laid out for 
scorpions, they kill them. Sea crabs can do the same
things but they work somewhat less effectively than
these. 
2-13. SKORPIOS CHERSAIOS
 Scorpionidae — Scorpion
The ground scorpion — taken raw, pounded into
small pieces, and so applied — is a remedy for the
hurt done by it. It is also roasted for the same purpose.

2-14. SKORPIOS THALASSIOS
SUGGESTED: Scorpaena, Scorpaenidae — Scorpion Fish
 Cottus scorpius — Sculpin 
The gall of the sea scorpion is good for bathing eyes,
white spots on the cornea, and excessive moisture in
the eyes.
2-15. DRAKON THALASSIOS
SUGGESTED: Trachinidae — Spiny-finned fishes, Weevers 
The sea dragon (opened and applied) is a cure for the
hurt done by his prickles. 
2-16. SKOLOPENDRA
SUGGESTED: Myriapoda, Cheilopoda — Sea Centipedes,
Millepedes 
The sea scolopendra boiled in oil and rubbed on
removes hair [ depilatory], but when touched it
breeds itching. 
2-17. NARKE
SUGGESTED: Torpedinidae — Electric Ray
The sea torpedo applied to sores of long endurance
around the head lessens the fierceness of the
suffering. The same applied lifts up a perineum that has
either overturned or else fallen down.
2-18. ECHIDNE
 Vipera communis, Coluber berus, Pelias berus — Viper 
The flesh of the viper (boiled and eaten) makes the
eyes quick-sighted and is also good for disorders of
the nerves. It represses enlarging scrofulous tumours
[glandular swelling, goitres]. You must (when you strip
it) cut off the head and the tail because they are without
 188
LIVING CREATURES

flesh. Cutting off the extreme parts by a certain measure
is but a tale. Then, the intestines having been taken out,
wash that which is left and cut it in pieces. Boil it with oil
and wine and a little salt and dill. Some say that from
feeding on them lice are bred in those who eat them but it 
is a lie. Some again say that those who eat them are long-
lived. Salts are made of them for the same uses, but they
do not work as well. The living viper is put into a new pot, 
and with it a pint of salt and [the same of] well-pounded
dry figs with six cups of honey. The cover of the pot is
tightly corked with clay and it is baked in an oven until
the salt has turned to coals. After this it is pounded into
small pieces and stored. Sometimes it may agree better
with the stomach if some spikenard [1-6, 1-7, 1-8, 1-10] or
phullon [3-140] or a little malabathrum [1-11] is mixed in. 
2-19. OPHEOS GERAS
 Senecta anguium — Sloughed Skin of Snakes 
The senecta anguium (which is the skin that the snake
casts in the spring time) boiled in wine is a remedy
for pain in the ears if it is poured into them, and for
toothache used as a mouth rinse. They mix it (especially
that of the sea viper) with eye medicines. 
2-20. LAGOOS THALASSIOS
  Aplysia depilans — Sea Hare
The sea hare is similar to the little cuttlefish. Pounded
into small pieces and applied (either by itself or with
sea nettles) it makes any place without hair [depilatory].
2-21. LAGOOS CHERSAIOS
  Lepus timidus — Hare
The brain of a land hare (eaten roasted) is good for the
trembling that comes from fear, as well as rubbed on
or eaten for teething in children. The head burnt and
rubbed on with bears’ grease or vinegar cures baldness.
The curds (taken in a drink three days after the menstrual

flow) are reported to cause sterility. Likewise it stops
excessive discharges of the womb and bowels. It helps
those with falling sickness, and taken as a drink with
vinegar it is good against poisons [antidote], especially
for curdling of the milk [while breastfeeding], and for the
bites of vipers. The blood rubbed on while warm cures
sunspots, vitiligines [form of leprosy], and freckles.
2-22. TRUGON THALASSIA
SUGGESTED: Trigonidae pastinaca — Sting Ray  
The radius of the pastinaca marina that grows out of its
tail (with scales turned backward) lessens a pained
tooth for it breaks and expels it.
2-23. SEPIA
SUGGESTED: Sepia officinalis — Cuttlefish
The black (ink) of the boiled sepia is hard to digest
when eaten and it softens the bowels. The shell
formed into washes is good to rub on rough cheeks.
Burnt in its own shell until the crusty matter is gone and
afterwards pounded into small pieces it cleans vitiligines
[form of leprosy], dandruff, teeth and sunspots. It is
washed and mixed with eye medicines. It is good for
white spots on the cornea (in the eyes) of cattle
[veterinary] blown into them. It removes pterygium
[membranes on eyes] pounded into small pieces with salt 
and applied. 
2-24. TRIGLA
SUGGESTED:  Mullidae, Mullus barbatus — Red Mullet
The mullus if often eaten is thought to cause dullness
of sight, but cut apart whilst it is raw and applied it
heals the hurt caused by the sea dragon [2-15], scorpion,
and the spider.

in wine against snakebite. 
2-26. KASTOROS ORCHIS
 Castoreum — Beaver 
obtained from two sacs in the groin of the Beaver
The beaver is a living creature with a double nature
nourished for the most part in the waters with the
fishes and crabs. Its stones [testicles] are good against the
poisons of snakes. They cause sneezing and are generally
effective for many purposes. Two teaspoonfuls (taken as
a drink with pulegium [3-36]) encourage the menstrual
flow, put out the afterbirth, and are an abortifacient. It is
taken as a drink with vinegar against gaseousness,
griping, hiccups, deadly poisons [ antidote] and ixia
[3-103]. Moistened with vinegar and rosaceum [1-53] it
revives the lethargic or those brought low in any way. It
does the same when smelled or inhaled as smoke. It is
good taken either as a drink or rubbed on for trembling,
convulsions, and all diseases of the nerves. Generally it is
warming. Always choose those stones [testicles] which
are connected together from one beginning (for it is
impossible to find two follicles [small glands] knit
together in one membrane); always distinguished by
their natural loose skins; and that have waxy stuff within, 
with a strong smell, poisonous, sharp, biting in taste,
easily crumbled. Some adulterate it by pouring
ammoniacum or gum tempered with blood and castoreum
into the follicle and drying it. It is not true that this beast
when it is pursued bites off his stones [testicles] and
throws them away, for it is impossible that he should
touch them as they are joined underneath like those of a
boar. Those who take off the skin must take the liquid in
there which looks similar to honey together with the
loose skin that contains it, dry it, then bottle and store it.

2-27. GALE KATOIKIDIOS 
 Putorius nivalis, Mustelidae — Weasel 
The household weasel is burned over flames after the
bowels are taken out, salted, and afterwards dried in
the shade and kept a long time. It is a very effective
remedy (taken as a drink of two teaspoonfuls in wine)
against all kinds of snakes. It is taken the same way as an
antidote to poisoning. The belly of the weasel is stuffed
with coriander and kept until it is old, then taken in a
drink to help those bitten by poisonous beasts, and the
epileptic. It is burnt complete together in a pot and the
ashes rubbed on with vinegar for gout. The blood rubbed
on helps scrofulous tumours [ glandular swelling,
goitres]. It is also good for epilepsy.
2-28. BATRACHOI
 genus Rana, family Ranidae — Frogs
Frogs are antidotes against the poisons of all snakes.
They are boiled into a broth in salt and oil. The broth
is then taken for this and for old abscesses of the tendons.
Burnt and then put on they staunch bleeding. They cure
alopecia [baldness] rubbed on with liquid pitch. The blood
of green frogs dropped on prevents the hair from ever
growing again once it has been pulled from the
eyebrows. They are good for toothache boiled together
with water and vinegar, and for the teeth when they are
washed with it.
2-29. AILOUROS
SUGGESTED: Silurus glanis, Siluridae — Sheath Fish
The silurus eaten whilst it is fresh is nourishing and
good for the stomach, but salted it yields no
nourishment; yet it cleans the arteries and makes the
voice clear. The flesh of that which is salted draws out
splinters. Brine from it is good in baths for dysentery at
the first sign, drawing the discharges to the outside.
Taken as a suppository it cures sciatica.
 194
LIVING CREATURES

2-30. SMARIS
SUGGESTED:  Osmerus eparlanus — Smelt 
The head of a salted smaris burnt stops abnormal
growths of (protuberant) flesh, stops gangrenous
ulceration; and removes corns and warty abnormal
growths. The flesh of this as well as all salted meat is good 
for one touched by a scorpion, and for one bitten by a
dog.
2-31. MAINIS
SUGGESTED: Maena 
 small sea-fish, eaten by the poor
The burnt head of the moena (pounded into small
pieces and sprinkled on) mends hard-skinned
fissures in the perineum; and its garum [Roman sauce
made of fermented fish] rolled up and down around the
mouth lessens rotten ulcers in there.
2-32. KOBIOS
SUGGESTED: Gobiidae, Gobius species — Sea Gudgeon
Place a freshly caught sea gudgeon in a swine’s
stomach and sew it up. Boil it with twelve pints of
water until it is reduced to two pints and then strain and
cool it in the open air. If you give it to someone to drink
you shall in this way bring down his bowels without any
disturbance. Applied it helps those bitten by dogs or
snakes. 
2-33. OMOTARICHOS
SUGGESTED: Orcynus thynus — Tunny 
Omotarichos is the flesh of the salted tunny. Those
bitten by the viper called prester (a serpent, the bite
of which was fabled to cause death by swelling) take this.
Those who eat it must be compelled to drink a great
 195
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

amount of wine and then to vomit. It is excellent for the
same purposes as eating sharp meats. It is also effective
applied to the bites of dogs. 
2-34. GARRON
SUGGESTED:  Garum — Liquid from Salt Fish 
Garum (the liquid that comes out of salted flesh or
fish), applied, represses gangrenous ulcers in the
cheeks, heals those bitten by dogs, and is sometimes
given as a suppository for dysentery and sciatica. It is
given to some so that it may repress ulcers (of the
bowels), to others that it may encourage ulceration of the
parts not ulcerated, and to remove fluids troubling the
hips. 
2-35. ZOMOS NEARON ICHTHUON
SUGGESTED: Fish Soup
Broth made from fresh fish (alone or taken as a drink
with wine) is able to soothe the bowels. The best
broth for this is made from the fish called  phycides?,
scorpion fish, julides, perch and other tender rock fish,
and those which do not have a poisonous nature, boiled
with nothing else but water and oil and anise [3-65] and
salt.
2-36. KOREIS
Cimices — Cimex lectularius, Cimex rotandatus — Bed Bugs 
Seven cimices taken and put in meat with beans and
swallowed down before a fit help those with quartains
[fever with paroxysm every three to four days].
Swallowed down without beans they help one bitten by
an asp. Smelled, they revive those fallen into a faint from
constriction of the vulva. Taken as a drink with wine or
vinegar they release horseleeches. Pounded into small
pieces and put into the urethra they cure painful
urination.

2-37. KOUBARIDES
 Oniscus asellus — Common Woodlouse
 ‘Millipede’ [old English] 
Millipedes that are found under water vessels are
creatures with many feet that roll themselves up
round when they are touched with the hand. Taken as a
drink with wine these help painful urination and yellow
jaundice. Rubbed on with honey they help those with
tonsillitis, and warmed in a pomegranate rind with
rosaceum [1-53] and dropped in the ears they are good for
earaches.
2-38. SILPHE 
Cockroach — Blatta orientalis
 THESE INSECTS ARE CARRIERS OF MANY DISEASES.
The inner parts of the kind of blatta which is found in
bakehouses and mill houses, pounded with oil or
boiled and dropped into the ears lessens their pain.
2-39. PNEUMON THALASSIOS
SUGGESTED:  Scopelidae, genus Plagyodus or Alepisaurus
 — Jellyfish family
translates as the lungs of the sea
Pulmo marinus pounded into small pieces (whilst it is
fresh), and applied, helps those troubled with
ulcerated chilblains and other chilblains, and those with
gout. 
2-40. PNEUMON CHOIRIOS
Lungs of Swine, Lamb or Bear
The lungs of a swine, lamb or bear applied to chafing
and blisters on the feet made by rubbing shoes
prevents inflammation.

Lungs of Fox 
Lungs of a fox (dried and taken in a drink) help the
asthmatic; and the grease of the same melted and
poured in the ears lessens earache.
2-42. HEPAR ONEIRON
Ass’s Liver
An ass’s liver eaten roasted is good for epilepsy but it
should be taken while fasting.
2-43. AIDOION ARRENOS ELAPHOU
Testes of Deer 
The genitals of a male hart (pounded into small pieces
and taken in a drink with wine) help those bitten by
vipers.
2-44. ONUCHES ONON
Ass’s Hooves 
Two spoonfuls of an ass’s hoof that has been burnt
(taken in a drink daily for many days) are said to cure
epilepsy. Steeped in oil they dissolve scrofulous tumours
[glandular swelling, goitres]; sprinkled on they heal
chilblains.
2-45. LEICHENES HIPPON
Spavins of Horses 
The lichen [bony excrescence on legs] of horses is
(according to description) that hardened substance
which grows at their knees and hooves. Pounded into

LIVING CREATURES

2-46. ONUCHES AIGON
Goats’ Hooves
The hooves of goats burnt and rubbed on with vinegar 
cure baldness. 
2-47. HEPAR AIGOS
Goat’s Liver
The watery fluid that drips from the liver of a goat
whilst it is a roasting is good rubbed on for those
troubled with night blindness. If anyone receives the
smoke of it with open eyes whilst it is boiling he receives
benefit from this. Eaten roasted it is good for the same
purpose. They say that epilepsy may be discerned by
eating the liver (especially) of the buck goat. 
2-48. HEPAR KAPROU
Boar’s Liver
The liver of a boar (taken whilst it is) fresh, dried and
pounded into small pieces and taken as a drink with
wine, is a remedy against the bites of snakes and beasts. 
2-49. HEPAR KUNOS LUSSONTOS
Liver of Mad Dog
RABIES IS HIGHLY COMMUNICABLE
The liver of a mad dog (eaten roasted by those which
have been bitten by him) is thought to keep them
safe from the fear of water. As a precaution they also use
the tooth of that dog which bit, place it into a bag and tie it 
to the arm.

Old Leather
The old leather of old soles of shoes (burnt, pounded
to powder and applied) helps burns, skin
inflammation from rubbing, chafing, and blisters caused
by wearing shoes. 
2-52. ALEKTORIDES
 Parts of Poultry
Hens cut apart and applied whilst they are yet warm
help the bites of snakes, but they must be changed
often. 
2-53. ENKEPHALOS ALEKTORIDOS
Parts of Poultry
Brains of poultry are given in a drink with wine to
those bitten by venomous creatures, and it also stops
discharges of blood from the meninx [membranes of the
brain and spinal cord]. The membrane of cocks which lies 
in the inner part under the ventricle, (hard and clear) like
a horn, and which has to have the skin taken off when it
is boiled, is good for the stomach, dried, pounded to a
powder and taken in a drink with wine. The broth of a
chicken dressed simply (without anything else) is
particularly given for restraining foul fluids, and for
those who have hot burning stomachs. Broth from old
cocks is given for purging the body. Having taken out the 
intestine [of the fowl] you must put in salt instead, sew
up the fowl, and boil it in twenty pints of water until they
reduce to one and a half pints, all which must be given
 200
LIVING CREATURES

after it has stood cooling awhile in the open air. There are
some who boil sea colewort, mercury [4-191], cnicum
[4-119, 4-190], or polypody [4-188] together with it. It draws 
out thick, raw, gluey (or sticky) black (fluids). It is good
for long-enduring acute fevers, the asthmatic, the
arthritic, and stomachs labouring with gas. The stomach
of fowls salted and dried in the shade is the best help.
Three teaspoonfuls are taken as an antidote against
excessive evacuations from purging medicines as it
presently stops the evacuating, but it must be pounded
into powder and mixed with water and given like that. 
2-54. OON
Eggs and their Yolk 
A soft-cooked egg nourishes more than an uncooked
one and a hard-cooked egg more than a soft. The
yolk roasted with saffron and rosaceum [1-53] is good for
sores in the eyes. It is good with melilot [3-48] for
inflammation around the perineum and the joints. Fried
in a pan with the seed of sumach or galls [oak galls] and
eaten (or else given alone) it stops discharges of the
bowels.
2-55. LEUKON TOU OOU
White of Egg 
The white of an egg used raw cools and closes the
pores of the skin, and when dropped on inflamed
eyes it soothes them. Rubbed on afterwards it prevents
burns from breaking out into pustules. It protects the face 
from sunburn. It constipates those troubled with
discharges, and will repress them when laid on the
forehead with frankincense. It lessens inflammation of
the eyes applied with wool and with rosaceum [1-53],
wine and honey mixed with it. If it is sipped raw it helps
bites of the snake called haemorrhois [a fable]; and
warmed a little it is good for bladder distress, ulcerated
kidneys, rough arteries, and the throwing up of blood,
mucus and fluids in the chest.

Grasshoppers if they are eaten roasted help disorders
of the bladder. 
2-57. AKRIDES
 Acridiiae, Oedipoda migratoria, Pachytylus migratorius 
— Locusts 
Locusts (smoked and inhaled) help difficulty in
urinating, especially in women. Their flesh is useless. 
One kind of locust called asiracos or onos is without wings, 
having great limbs when it is young. This is dried and
taken in a drink with wine as a great help to those bitten
by scorpions. The Africans who inhabit Leptis feed on
these abundantly [food]. 
2-58. PHINIS
  Pandion [Falco] haliaëtus — Osprey, Ossifrage
Phinis is a bird that they call ossifragum in Latin. When
given little by little of this in drink it is said to expel
stones from urine.
2-59. KORUDALLOS
 Alauda arvensis — Skylark, Crested Lark 
The lark is only a little bird having on the top of its
head a tuft standing up similar to that of the peacock. 
This bird eaten roasted is good for those troubled with
colic. 
2-60. CHELIDON
Hirundo rustica — Swallows  
Cutting apart [at the increase of the moon] young
swallows of the first hatching, you shall find stones
 202
LIVING CREATURES

in their bellies, of which take two, one of various colours
and the other clear [and of one colour]. Place these in an
heifer’s or hart’s skin before they touch the ground and
tie them to the arm or neck. You shall with this ease and
often wholly recover from epilepsy. Swallows are eaten
with their ficedulae [intestines] as a medicine for causing
sharp sight, and the ashes of them and of their female
parents burnt in a ceramic pot and rubbed on with honey
cause sharpness of sight. It is also good rubbed on for
those with tonsillitis, and for inflammation of the uvula
and tonsils. Swallows and their young ones (dried, and
one teaspoon taken in a drink with water) help those
who have tonsillitis. 
2-61. ELEPHANTOS ODONTOS

for a long time.
2-63. ELAPHOU KERAS
Burnt Horn of a Hart  — adult male Red Deer
The horn of a hart (burnt, washed and two spoonfuls
taken in a drink) is good with gum tragacanth for
bloodspitters, dysentery, coeliac [ intestinal complaints],
jaundice and disorders of the bladder. It is also good for
women troubled with excessive [ menstrual] discharge,
given with some liquid suitable for that suffering. It is
burnt in an oven (first pounded and put into an unfired
clay pot, sealed around with clay, and fired) until it is
 203
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

white, and then afterwards it is washed in a similar way
to cadmia [5-84]. This is good for discharges and ulcers in
the eyes; and rubbed on the teeth it cleans them. If burnt
raw it drives away snakes with the smell. Boiled with
vinegar and used as a mouthwash it soothes pain of the
inner teeth.
2-64. KAMPAI
Caterpillars
The erucae [caterpillars] which breed on vegetables

 Cantharides vesicatoria — Spanish Fly Beetles 
POISONOUS
Those dried beetles that are gathered from the corn
are fit for storage. Place them into an unglazed jar
and tie around the mouth of it a clean thin linen cloth:
turn them towards the fumes of very sharp warmed
vinegar and hold them there until they are stifled. Then
thrust them through with a thread and store them. The
most effective have the most diversity of colours,
yellowish cross streaks [in their wings], and are long-
bodied, full and fat, like the blattae [cockroaches]. Those
of one colour are ineffective.
2-66. BOUPRESTEIS
 Buprestis — Buprestidae — Bupressedes
POISONOUS
In the same way the bupressedes are preserved for
storage. They are types of cantharides [2-65] and erucae
[caterpillars] of the pine tree. Roasted a little in hot ashes,
they are stored and kept in a sieve that hangs up. Their
common strength [see above] is antiseptic, anti-ulcerous
and heating; as a result they are mixed in medicines that
cure diseases of the cornea, leprosy and wild impetigo
 204
LIVING CREATURES

[skin infection]. Mixed with soothing suppositories they
encourage the menstrual flow. Some also have related
that these cantharides [2-65] help dropsy by moving the
urine. Some also believe that the wings and feet of them
are an antidote for those who have taken parasites in a
drink. 
2-67. SALAMANDRA
Salamandridae — Salamander  
The salamander is a kind of lizard, lazy, variously
spotted, in vain thought fireproof. It is antiseptic,
ulcerating, and heating. They are mixed in antiseptic and
leprosy medicines to the same benefit as cantharides [2-65]
and kept in store in a similar way. Moistened with oil
they remove hair [depilatory]. They are disembowelled,
the head and the feet taken away, and preserved in
honey for the same uses. 
2-68. ARACHNE
Arachneidae — Spiders 
The spider — a creature also called holcos or lycos (that
is, raptor, for example, lupus) — worked into one
piece with a plaster, spread on linen and applied to the
forehead or temples, cures the periodical circuits of
paroxysm every third day in acute fevers. The cobwebs of 
spiders are applied to staunch blood, and prevent
inflammation in ulcers that break out on the surface of
the skin. There is another kind of spider which spins a
white web, thin and thick, of which it is said that when
put into a purse of leather and hanged around the arm it
cures the flows of quartain [with paroxysms every fourth
day] acute fevers. Boiled together with rosaceum [1-53]
and poured in the ears it helps earaches.

warts, pensiles [growths which hang down] (which they
call acrochordonas [hanging warts]) and corns. The liver is
put into the cavities of teeth to cause the pain to cease.
Cut quite apart and applied it eases those touched by a

Schinchi are found in Egypt, India and some at the Red
Sea. Some are found in Libya, others near a river of
Mauritania. It is an earth crocodile of its own kind that is
preserved in salt with nasturtium [2-185]. They say that a
teaspoonful of the part of it that lies around the kidneys
(taken in a drink of wine) is a great provocative to lust
[aphrodisiac], and yet for all that, a decoction of lentils
taken as a drink with honey (or the seed of lettuce taken
in a drink with water) represses the intensity of this
inclination. It is also mixed with antidotes.
2-72. ENTERA GES
 Lumbricus — Earthworms 
Worms from the soil (pounded into small pieces and

poured into the opposing ear they help toothaches.
Pounded into small pieces and taken in a drink with

Mus musculus — House Mouse
It is declared that cut-apart house mice are usefully
applied to those touched by scorpions, and that eaten
roasted they dry the spittle in the mouths of children. 
2-75. GALA
SUGGESTED: Milk
All milk is commonly good to drink, nourishing,
softening to the intestines, and causing the stomach
and bowels to be inflated with gas. That which is made in
the spring has a more watery substance than that of the
summer, and that which comes from green pasture
softens the intestines more. The best milk is white, has an
equal thickness, and ‘beads’ when it is dropped on a
fingernail. Goat’s milk disturbs the intestines less because 
goats for the most part feed on astringent food such as the 
oak, lentisk [1-90], and the leaves of the olive tree and
terminthos[1-91]. As a result it is also good for the stomach. 
Sheep milk is both thick and sweet and very fat but not so
good for the stomach. Cow’s, asses' and mare’s milk make 
the intestines more laxative and trouble it. All milk
overturns the stomach and the intestines where the
pasture is scammonious or has hellebore, mercury [4-191] 
or clematis, as has been observed by us in the Vestin
mountains. For goats vomit which feed on the leaves of
the white hellebore when they first shoot out; and their
 207
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

milk overturns the stomach and has a nauseous nature.
All milk when boiled becomes astringent to the
intestines, especially that which is evaporated by burning 
flints. In general it helps all internal ulcers, especially of
the throat, lungs, intestines, kidneys and bladder.
Against all itchiness in appearance, pustules and corrupt
fluids it is given fresh with raw honey and a little water
mixed together (salt also being mixed with it). That which 
has been once boiled is less inflating. That which is boiled
with pebble stones and reduced to half, helps discharges
of the bowels accompanied with ulceration.
2-76. ORROS GALAKTOS
SUGGESTED: Whey
All milk has whey contained within it. Separated out,
this is fitter for purging and is given to those whom
we would purge without distress, as well as for
depression, epilepsy, leprosy, elephantiasis, and pustules
that break out over the whole body.
2-77. GALA SCHISTON
SUGGESTED:  Junket
All milk is separated by boiling it in a new ceramic jar
and stirring it with a freshly cut down fig tree
branch. After it has boiled two or three times a wine-cup
of vinegar and honey for every half-pint of milk is poured 
into it: thus the whey is parted from the cheesy matter. So 
that the milk does not boil over you must continually rub
the brim of the jar with a sponge dipped in cold water
during boiling, and let down a silver pint jar full of cold
water into it. Whey is given to drink (at intervals) in
amounts of from one half-pint to five, and let those who
drink it walk around during that time. New milk is good
for ulcers, and inflammation caused by deadly medicines
like cantharis [2-65], pityocampa [pine grub or pine
caterpillar], salamander, buprestis [2-66], hyoscyamus
[4-69], dorycnium [4-75], aconitum [4-77, 4-78], or
ephemerum [4-85]. For this cow’s milk helps best. It is also
gargled for ulcers of the mouth and tonsils. Especially
asses' milk gargled in the mouth strengthens the gums
 208
LIVING CREATURES

and the teeth. If you place hot burning flints into the milk
of sheep, cows, or goats to boli it, this stops discharges
accompanied with ulceration. It is given as a suppository
or enema (either by itself or with barley water or cream of
halica [2-114]) to relieve considerable gnawing of the
intestines. It is also squirted into an ulcerated vulva.
2-78. GALA GUNAIKOS
SUGGESTED: Woman’s Milk 
Woman’s milk is the sweetest and most nourishing.
Sucked, it is good for pangs of hunger in the
stomach and for consumption. It is also an antidote in a
drink for someone that has taken sea hare [2-20]. Mixed
with frankincense that has been pounded into small
pieces, it is dropped into eyes that are bloodshot from a
blow. It is good for gout rubbed on with meconium [4-65]
and ceratium [wax ointments]. All milk is worthless for the 
splenetic and hepatic, vertigo, epilepsy, and those
troubled in their tendons, those who have fevers or
whose heads ache, unless at any time one gives them
whey for purgation as was formerly shown. Some say
that the milk of a bitch when she first whelps removes
hair when rubbed on. Taken as a drink it is an antidote
against poisonous medicines, and casts out dead
embryos.
2-79. TUROS NEAROS
SUGGESTED: New Cheese 
New cheese eaten without salt is nourishing, good
for the stomach, easy to digest, increasing the flesh
[weight gain] and mildly softening the bowels. Some is
better than the other, according to the nature of the milk
from which it is made. Boiled and strained out, then
roasted, it is astringent in the intestines, and applied it is
good for inflammation and bruises of the eyes. New
salted cheese is more nourishing and if eaten is good for
shrinking of the flesh [ weight loss]. It is bad for the
stomach, upsetting the intestines and the bowels. That
 209
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

which is older is therapeutic for the intestines, and the
whey that is made along with cheese is very good
nourishment for dogs. 
2-80. HIPPACE
SUGGESTED: Horse Cheese 
That which they call  hippace is horse cheese. It has a
poisonous smell yet is very nourishing and very
similar to that made from pigs’ milk. Some have called
the horse’s rennet by the name of hippace.
2-81. BUTURON
SUGGESTED:  Butter
Good butter is made of the fattest milk such as ewes’
milk. It is also made from milk of goats, the milk
being stirred around in jars until the fat is separated. It is
softening and has the qualities of oil. Taken by itself it
loosens the intestines, and when oil is not available it is an 
antidote against poison. Mixed and rubbed on with
honey it helps teething and itching of the gums in
children, and ulcers of the mouth [thrush, candidiasis].
Rubbed on externally it preserves the body and prevents
pustules from breaking out. Butter that is neither stinking 
nor old is good against inflammations and hard lumps of
the womb. It is given as a suppository for dysentery and
ulceration of the colus [? possibly colon]. It is also of
benefit mixed in suppurating medicines — especially for
wounds around the nerves, neural membrane, bladder
and neck. It fills and cleans and encourages new flesh.
Applied it is good for one bitten by an asp. New butter is
put in sauce for meats instead of oil, and in cakes instead
of fat. 
Soot is gathered from butter as follows. Pour some
butter into a new lamp, set it on fire and having covered it 
let it burn in a ceramic jar made similar to a siphunculus [a
little pipe from which water spurts], narrow above but
with holes underneath. When the first butter is used up
pour in more and repeat the procedure until you have
got as much soot as you desire. Then scrape it off with a
 210
LIVING CREATURES

feather or wing and use it. It is useful in eye medicines, to
dry, and as an astringent. It stops discharges and quickly
brings ulcers to a scar. 
2-82. ERIA
SUGGESTED: Wool
The best, unwashed wool is softest, like that from the
neck and from the thighs. It is good (moistened in
vinegar and oil or wine) as first treatment for wounds,
bruises, peeling, black and blue bruises, and broken
bones. For it easily drinks up the liquors into which it is
dipped, and by reason of the oesypum [lanolin] that it
contains it is softening. It is good applied with vinegar
and rosaceum [1-53] for headaches and pains in the
stomach or any other place.
2-83. ERIA KEKAUMENA
SUGGESTED: Burnt Wool 
Burnt wool has the properties of scab forming,
repressing abnormal growths of flesh, and drawing
ulcers to a scar. It is burnt in an unfired clay jar (in the
same way as other things) after being cleaned and
carded. Locks of wool that have been dyed with sea
purple [pupurea — shellfish] are burnt in the same way.
Some card the wool with the lanolin on, moisten it with
honey and burn it. Some lay little spits [skewers] in a
ceramic jar with a broad mouth, separate from one
another, and lay thin chips of teda [taeda — pitch pine] on
it, then place the wool (carded and moistened with oil) on 
them so that it may not fall. Layering the chips and the
wool one on the other by turn they set the teda [chips]
gently on fire underneath and take them away when
they have burnt out. If any fat or pitch falls down from
the teda it is taken and stored separately. The ash from
wool is washed for eye medicines in a ceramic jar. Water
is poured on it and lustily stirred around with the hands,
and after it is settled the water is poured out and other
poured on and stirred around again. This is done until it
does not bite if applied to the tongue but is somewhat
astringent.

FATS 
2-84. OISUPON
SUGGESTED: Wool Fat, Lanolin
The greasiness of unwashed wool is called oesypum
[lanolin]. You can prepare it as follows. Take soft
unwashed wool scoured with the herb soapweed
[soapwort], wash it in hot water, squeeze out all the filth,
throw it into a broad-mouthed jar, and pouring water on
it pour it from on high back again with a great spoon,
tumbling it down forcibly until it foams, or stir it around
lustily with a stick until a quantity of foul foam gathers
together. Afterwards sprinkle it with seawater. When the
fat that swims on top has settled, put it into another
ceramic jar, and pouring water into the jar stir it around
again and sprinkle the foam with water and repeat as
above. Do this until there is no more foam on it, the
greasy matter having been used up. Mix the oesypum
[lanolin] that is gathered by hand. If it has any filth
remaining on it take it away. Let the first water fall away
drop by drop, pour in more and stir it around with the
hand until, if applied to the tongue it does not bite, is
somewhat astringent and it looks fat, clean and white.
Store it in a ceramic jar. This should be done while the
sun is warm. Some press out the grease and wash it in
cold water, rubbing it with their hands as women do stiff
ointments and this is whiter. Others wash the wool and
press out the filth, boil it with water in a kettle over a
gentle fire, take away the grease that floats on top and
wash it in water as was already explained. Straining it out 
into a ceramic platter that has warm water in it, they
cover it with a linen cloth and set it out in the sun until it
becomes sufficiently thick and white. Some (after two
days) pour out the first water and pour in fresh. The best
is not cleaned with radicula [radish], is smooth, smells of
unwashed wool, and when rubbed with cold water in a
shell, grows white. It has nothing in it hard or compacted
such as that counterfeited with wax ointment or animal
fat. It is able to warm and soften and fill ulcers, especially
those around the perineum and vulva. Applied in wool
with melilot [3-48] and butter it is an abortifacient and
 212
FATS 

draws out the menstrual flow, (and is good) with goose
grease for sores in the ears and genitals. It is also good
around the corners of eyes that have been eaten into and
are scabbed, and for eyelids that have grown hard and
shed their hair. Oesypum [lanolin] is burnt in a new
ceramic jar until it is turned into ashes and loses all its fat.
Soot is gathered from it (in the same way as we have
previously described), good for eye medicines. 
2-85. PITUA
SUGGESTED: Rennet 
Thirty grains of rennet of hare (taken in a drink of
wine) is good for those bitten by venomous
creatures, coeliac [ intestinal complaints], dysentery, for
women troubled with excessive discharges from the
womb, for clotting blood together, and for throwing
blood up out of the chest. Applied after the cleansing
(that is, monthly, and a little before lying together) to the
vulva with butter it causes inconception. Taken in a drink 
it is an abortifacient, and after the menstrual flow
purging it hinders conception [birth control]. Rennet of a
horse that some call hippace is particularly good for the
abdominal cavity and dysentery. Rennet of a lamb, kid,
fawn, doe, platyceros [stag], dorcas [Dorcatherium aquaticum
— ruminant], deer, calf, and wild ox have similar
properties and are good (taken as a drink in wine) as an
antidote against aconitum [4-77, 4-78], and for clotting
milk if used with vinegar. In particular the rennet of a
fawn applied the third day after the monthly purgation
hinders conception. Rennet of the sea calf [seal — Phoca
vitulina] has a strength very similar to castorium [2-26]. It is 
thought to be especially good (taken as a drink) for
epilepsy, and for constriction of the womb. Now to know
whether it is the authentic rennet of sea calf it is tested as
follows. Take the rennet of some other creature
(especially of a lamb) and having put water onto it leave it 
alone a little while. Afterwards pour the liquid in which
that rennet lay on the rennet of the sea calf. If it is
authentic it immediately melts into the water, and if it is
not it remains as it was. Sea calves’ rennet is taken from
the young ones when not yet able to swim together (with
 213
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

the old). In general all rennet gathers together things that
are scattered and dissolves things that are gathered
together. 
2-86. STEAR
SUGGESTED: Goose Grease
New fat of either geese or poultry (even if it is kept
long, but without salt) is good for disorders of the
womb. That which is salted or has turned sour through
age is an enemy to the womb. Take any of these, fresh,
and strip off the skin from it. Put it into a new ceramic jar
that could contain twice as much fat as you mean to
provide. Having covered the jar carefully set it out in a
very hot sun then strain out the part which has melted
into another ceramic jar until all is used, then put it into a
very cold place and use it. Some, instead of the sun, set
the jar over hot water or over a small and gentle coal fire.
There is also another way of preparing it as follows. After
the skin is removed from the fat, it is pounded and put on 
to a platter, melted, and a little fine salt is put on it, then it
is strained through a linen cloth and put in jars. This fat is
good mixed with medicines that take away weariness.
2-87. STEAR HUEION KAI ARNEION
SUGGESTED: Lard and Bear Grease
Fats from swine or bears are prepared as follows. Take
the new thick fat that grows around the kidneys,
remove the skin, and put it into a good amount of very
cold rain water, rubbing it carefully with the hands and
(as it were) reviving it again. Having washed it often in
clean water, put it into a ceramic jar that will hold twice
the amount, add enough water to cover the fat, set it over
a gentle fire of coals and stir it with a continuous
splashing. When it has melted strain it through a strainer
into water and let it cool. Then removing all the water
gently from it, carefully put it again into another jar
already washed beforehand, place water on it and melt it
gently. Having taken it down and allowed the dregs to
settle a little put it into a mortar moistened with a sponge. 
When it has congealed take it down and take off the filth
 214
FATS 

lying in the bottom. Melt it again a third time without
water and pour it again into the mortar. Having cleaned
it, store it in tightly corked ceramic jars and put the jars in
a very cold place. 
2-88. STEAR TRAGEION, KAI
PROBATEION, KAI ELAPHEION
SUGGESTED: Mutton Suet etc.
Goat, sheep and furthermore deer suet is prepared as
follows. Take the fat of any of these (as described in
the previous discussion) and having washed it (as
explained in the preparation of fat of swine) remove the
skin, put it into a mortar to temper it and beat it, pouring
in a little water until nothing similar to blood comes from
it, no fat swims on it, and it becomes clear. Then throw it
into a ceramic jar and add to it enough water to cover it,
put it over a gentle coal fire and stir it around. When it is
all melted, pour it into water and cool it. Having washed
the jar, melt the suet a second time and repeat the
procedure. Then having melted it a third time without
water, strain it out into a mortar moistened with water,
and when it is cold bottle it for storage like fat of swine. 
2-89. STEAR BOEION
SUGGESTED: Ox or Cow Suet
From ox or cow suet (which is near the kidneys) the
skin is to be taken off, and it must be washed in sea
water taken out of the ocean, then it must be put into a
mortar and pounded carefully, sprinkling the seawater
on it. When it is all dissolved it must be put into a ceramic
jar and sea water poured into it to stand no less than
twenty centimetres above it, and it must be boiled until it
has lost its own smell. Afterwards for every Attic
[Athenian] pound of the suet you must put in four
teaspoonfuls of Tyrrhenian [Etruscan] wax. Then (having 
strained it and taken away the filth that lies in the
bottom) it must be put into a new jar. Afterwards it is
covered and is to be set out every day in the sun so that it
may become white and lose its bad taste.

KAI LEONTEION
SUGGESTED: Bulls’ Suet etc.
Bulls’ suet must be prepared as follows. Take new fat
from the kidneys, wash it with running water from
the river, and having pulled off the skin put the fat into a
new clay jar, sprinkle a little salt on it and melt it. Then
strain it out into clear water. When it begins to congeal
rub it diligently with the hands again, pouring out and
pouring on water until it is thoroughly washed. Then
place it into the jar again and boil it with the same
amount of sweet-smelling wine. When it has boiled
twice, remove the jar from the fire and let the fat remain
in there all night. If there is any bad smell left in it the day
after, place it into another ceramic jar, pour
sweet-smelling wine on it again and repeat (as has been
formerly described) until it discards all rank smell. It is
also melted without salt to be used in some sores for
which salt is not indicated. Prepared like this it is not very 
white. In the same way panthers’, lions’, wild boars’,
camels’, horses’, and other similar fats are prepared.
2-91. STEAR POS AROMATISTEON
SUGGESTED: Fats Blended with Scent 
Calves’ fat as well as fat from bulls and deer and the
bone marrow of deer are given a sweet smell as
follows. Remove the skin from the fat you want to
perfume, wash it as shown above and boil it in fragrant
wine without any sea water in it. Afterwards cool it down
and let it remain all night. Then pour in more of the same
kind of wine, the same amount as before, melt it and
carefully skim it. For every four and a half pints of fat add
seven teaspoonfuls of  juncus arabicus  [1-16, 4-52].  If you
would like to make it smell sweeter, add to this forty
teaspoonfuls of flowers of juncus arabicus, and as many
teaspoonfuls of palm, cassia and calamus [1-17, 1-114], and 
one teaspoon each of aspalathus [1-19] and xylobalsamum
[1-18]. Mix with all of this one ounce each of cinnamon,
cardamom and nardus[1-6, 1-7, 1-8, 1-10]. Let all of them
be pounded very finely. Afterwards pour in fragrant
 216
FATS 

wine, cork the jar tightly, set it securely over coals and
boil it all together three times. Then take it from the fire
and let it remain in the jar all night. On the following day
pour out the wine and put in more of the same kind, boil
it together three times in a similar way and remove it. On
the next morning (after having taken out the salt) pour
out the wine, then wash the jar and take away the filth
that sticks in the bottom, melt and strain the fat, put it in
jars and use it. 
In the same way fat that was prepared beforehand is
made sweet smelling. The previously described fats are
first thickened as follows so that they may more readily
receive the strength of the sweet odour. Take the fat and
boil it with wine; place in there a myrtle  branch,
serpyllum, [3-46] and cyprus [1-124], as well as aspalathus
[1-19] (all thoroughly pounded). Some are content with
one of these for this purpose. When the fat has boiled for
the third time, take it off gently, strain it through a linen
cloth and then aromatize it as described already. 
Fats are also thickened as follows. Pound whatever
fats you have (which are new and not mixed with blood
or having other marks which have been often spoken of).
Put them into a new jar and pour in old odoriferous
white wine so that it exceeds eight fingers in depth. Boil
them together using a slow fire until the fat has lost its
native scent and rather smells of the wine. Then take off
the jar and cool it. Take out two pounds of the fat and
place it into a jar and add four half-pints of the same wine 
and four pounds of pounded seeds from a lotus tree
[1-171], and that tree whose wood those who make pipes
use. Boil it over a gentle fire stirring it around
continuously, and when it has lost all its strong greasy
smell, strain it and let it cool. Take one pound of bruised
aspalathus [1-19] and four pounds of the flowers of
amaracinum [1-68], steep them in old wine and let them
absorb it for one night. Then on the following day put
them with the fat into a new ceramic jar that will hold
three gallons, and add to this two and a quarter litres of
wine and boil everything together. When the fat has
received all the strength and smell of the thickeners take
it down, strain it, melt it and put it in jars. If you wish to
make it smell sweeter, mix with all of this eight
teaspoonfuls of the fattest myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116]
diluted in very old wine. 
 217
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

Poultry or goose grease is given a sweet scent as
follows. Take two pints of either of these fats (which have
been already prepared), place them into an earthenware
pot, mix with it exactly twelve teaspoonfuls each of
pounded erysisceptrum [1-4], xylobalsamum [1-18], palma
elaterium [4-155], and calamus [1-17, 1-114], and having
added to this one wine-cupful of old Lesbos wine, set it
over the coals and make it boil three times. Then take the
jar from the fire and allow the things in it to cool for one
day and night. The following day melt them and press
them through a clean linen cloth into a clean jar. When
the fat congeals take it out with a spoon (as previously
described) put it into a new ceramic jar, stop it tightly,
and put the jars in a very cold place. All this must be done
in the winter for in the summer it will not adhere
together. Some to help the process mix in a little
Tyrrhenian wax. In the same way both swine fat and bear 
fat and other similar fats are given a fragrant smell.
2-92. STEAR POS SAMPSUCHITETAI
 To Perfume Fat with Sampsuchum 
SUGGESTED:  Amaracus, Maiorana [Fuchs], Majorana vulgaris
[Bauhin], Sampsuchum, Sampsucum, Origanum majorum
[Pliny], Origanum majorana [Linneaus], 
Origanum majoranoides, Majorana hortensis 
— Sweet Marjoram, Knotted Marjoram
Fat is made to smell like sampsuchum as follows. Take
one pound of well-prepared fat (especially bulls’ fat)
and a pound and a half of carefully bruised ripe
sampsuchum, mix them, sprinkle on it a good quantity of
wine and form them into little cakes. Afterwards place
them into a jar, cover them and let them remain for that
night. In the morning throw them into a ceramic jar, pour 
water on them and boil them gently. When the fat loses
its own taste, strain it and let it stand (well-covered) all
that night. The next morning take out the paste, and
having cooled it, wipe away the filth in the bottom. Mix in 
again another pound and a half of bruised sampsuchum
(as before), and make it into little cakes again, repeating
the remainder of the process. Most importantly boil and
strain it, and additionally take away the filth if any
remains in the bottom, and put it in jars in a very cold
place.

SUGGESTED: Preserving Fat of Geese and Poultry 
If anyone wants to preserve fat of geese, poultry or
calves (which has not been prepared) from putrefying,
it can be done as follows. Take whichever fresh fat you
have, wash it well, and after you have thoroughly cooled
it in a sieve in the shade (when it is dry) put it into a clean
linen cloth and press it out strongly with your hands.
Then (having put a string through it) hang it up in a
shady place. After many days wrap it in new paper and
put it in jars in a very cold place. Fats also remain pure
stored in honey. 
2-94. STEATON DUNAMIS
SUGGESTED: Medicinal uses of Fats
All fat is warming, softening and purifying; yet that of
bulls, cows and calves is somewhat astringent. The
lions’ is similar to these and they say it is an antidote to
defend against those who intend treachery. Fat from
elephants and deer (rubbed on) drives away snakes. That
from goats is more astringent, as a result it is given boiled
with polenta, rhoe [4-64] and cheese for dysentery; and
with barley water as a suppository or enema. The broth of 
these fats (sipped) is good for those with pulmonary
consumption, and is effective given as an antidote to
those who have taken a drink of parasitically infected
water. Fat from goats has the most dissolving nature and
helps the gouty, tempered with the berries of a goat [i.e.
with goat’s dung] and saffron and applied. Sheep fat is
equivalent to this. Swines’ fat is applied for disorders of
the womb and perineum, and is also good for those burnt 
by fire. The same (kept in salt and grown very old in there 
as it were) warms and soothes. Washed in wine it is good
for pleurisy. The same (applied with ash or chalk) is good
for oedema, inflammation and fistulas [ulcers]. They say
that ass's fat makes scars all one colour. Fats of geese and
poultry are good for women’s disorders, cracks of the
lips, clearing the face, and for sores of the ears. Bears’ fat is 
thought to make hair that was destroyed by alopecia
 219
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

[baldness] grow again, and is good for chilblains. Foxes’
fat cures sores of the ears. Fat of river fish (melted in the
sun and mixed with honey) rubbed on the eyes clears
their sight. The fat of a viper mixed (in equal parts) with
cedria [1-105] Attic [Athenian] honey and old oil is also
good for dullness of the sight and liquids in the eyes. It
makes hair in the armpits that has been removed never
come up again, applied by itself at the roots of the hair
[depilatory].
2-95. MUELOI
SUGGESTED: Bone Marrow
Deer marrow is the best, then that from a calf, after,
that from a bull, then a goat and a sheep. They are
gathered at the time when spring is drawing on, and
towards the autumn, for at other times of the year it is
found in the bones — looking bloody and similar to flesh
that is easily broken. It is hard to recognise except by
whoever takes it out of the bones and preserves it. All
marrow is softening, purifying, and healing, and fills up
the hollow sores of ulcers. The bone marrow of a deer
(rubbed on) also drives away venomous creatures. It is
prepared like fat [above] being taken out of the choicest
and freshest bones. Water is poured on it, and afterwards
it is strained through a linen cloth and similarly washed
until the water becomes clean. Afterwards it is melted in a 
double jar, the filth that swims on top is taken off with a
feather, and it is strained out into a mortar. After it has
congealed it is stored in a new earthenware jar, the filth
that lies at the bottom having been carefully scraped
away. If you want to store it unprepared follow the
directions given in fats of poultry and of geese.
2-96. CHOLE PASA
SUGGESTED: Gall from various Animals 
All kinds of gall is prepared and stored as follows.
Take gall that is new, bind the mouth [of the gall
bladder] with a linen thread, put it into boiling water, and 
then let it remain for as long as it would take to travel
three furlongs [3/8 mile]. Afterwards take it out and dry it
 220
FATS 

in a shady dry place. For galls that you intend to mix with
eye medicines, bind them with a linen thread, put them
into a glass bottle containing honey, tie the beginning of
the thread to the mouth of the bottle, then cork it and put
it in storage. 
All kinds of gall are sharp and warming, varying in
strength depending on their source. Galls from sea
scorpions [2-14], the fish called callionymus [uranoscopus],
sea turtles and hyenas seem to be more effective; as well
as that of partridge, eagle, white hens and wild she-goats. 
They serve effectively for liquids and darkness of the eyes 
that has recently begun, argema [small white ulcer on the
cornea], and coarse eyelids. A bull’s gall is more effective
than that from a sheep, swine, or goat, as well as that
from a bear. All of them have a tendency to laxativeness
(especially in children), if, dipping a lock of wool in there,
you apply it to the perineum. Bulls’ gall with honey is
effectively rubbed on those troubled with tonsillitis. It
heals [ ulcers] on the perineum to a scar, and purulent
ears and cracks in them, dropped in with goats’ milk or
women’s, and it is also good for noise in the ears
[dropped in] with juice from leeks. It is put into wound
plasters, and ointments that are rubbed about the body to 
prevent poisoning. It is good with honey against
spreading erosive ulcers, and pains of the genitals and of
the scrotum. It is an excellent cleanser for leprosy and
dandruff with nitre [potassium nitrate — saltpetre] or
fuller's earth [ammonium silicate]. Sheep and bear galls
are good for the same purposes but they are somewhat
weaker: bear gall (taken in a linctus [syrup]) helps those
with falling sickness. Gall from a tortoise is put into the
nostrils for tonsillitis, and is also good for gangrenous
ulceration in the mouths of children, and epilepsy. Gall
from a wild she-goat rubbed on effectively cures the
dim-sighted. That from a he-goat does the same, and also
takes away glandular fever. Rubbed on, it represses the
protuberances of elephantiasis [ skin disease]. Gall from
swine is effective taken for ulcers in the ears and all the
other things.

Blood — CAUTION 
Blood from a goose, duck, drake, or kid are usefully
mixed with antidotes. Blood from a wood dove,
turtle, pigeon, and partridge are rubbed on new sores on
eyes and on eyes that are bloodshot and have dull sight.
In particular that from a pigeon stops bleeding from the
meninges [membranes of the spinal cord and brain]. Blood 
from a he-goat, she-goat, deer or hare (fried in a pan and
eaten) stop dysentery and discharges of the abdominal
cavity. Taken in a drink with wine it is an antidote against 
poison. A hare’s blood rubbed on warm cures sunburn
and freckles. Dog’s blood (taken as a drink) is good for
those bitten by a mad dog, or who have taken poison in a
drink. Blood from an earth tortoise (taken as a drink) is
said to be good for epileptics. Blood of a sea turtle (taken
in a drink with wine, rennet of a hare and cumin), is good
against the bites of venomous creatures, and an antidote
for drinking anything hateful or loathsome. Blood from a
bull applied with polenta disperses and softens hardness. 
Blood of stallion horses is mixed with antiseptic
medicines. Blood from a chamaeleon is believed to make
the eyelids hairless, and that from green frogs is thought
to have the same effectiveness. The menstrual blood of a
woman rubbed on her (or if she walks over it) is thought
to keep her from conception; yet rubbed on it alleviates
the pains of gout and erysipela [ streptococcal skin
infection].
2-98. APOPATOS
Dung — CAUTION
The dung of a cow from the herd (applied whilst fresh) 
lessens the inflammation of wounds. It is wrapped in 
leaves, warmed in hot ashes, and applied. The
application of it in the same way serves as a warm pack
for lessening sciatica. Applied with vinegar it dissolves
hardness, scrofulous tumours [ goitres], and bone
inflammation. In particular, breathing smoke from the
burning dung of a male beast of the herd restores a uterus 
that has fallen down, and the fumes also drive gnats
 222
FATS 

away. The berries [dung] of goats, especially those that
live on the mountains, (taken in a drink with wine) cures
yellow jaundice. Taken in a drink with spices they induce 
the menstrual flow and are an abortifacient. Dried and
pounded into small pieces and applied in wool with
frankincense they stop the flows of women, and with
vinegar they restrain other discharges of blood. They
cure baldness, burnt and rubbed on with vinegar or
vinegar and honey. Applied with swines’ grease they
help the gouty. Boiled with vinegar or wine they are
applied to the bites of snakes, creeping ulcers, erysipela
[streptococcal skin infection] and parotitis [inflamed
glands e.g. mumps]. Burnt goat dung is effectively taken
for sciatica as follows. In that hollow middle space
between thumb and forefinger where the thumb
approaches towards the wrist, first lay wool moistened in 
oil, then lay on it one by one hot pills of goat dung until
the sense of it comes through the arm to the hip and
lessens the pain. This type of burning is called Arabic. The 
dung of sheep applied with vinegar heals epinyctis
[pustules which appear only at night], corns, hanging
warts, and warty abnormal growths; as well as burns,
used with a waxy ointment of rosaceum [1-53]. The dry
(dung) of a wild swine (taken as a drink with water or
wine) prevents throwing up of blood, and lessens a long-
enduring pain of the side. For hernia and convulsions it is 
taken as a drink with vinegar, and it cures dislocations
used with rosaceum [1-53] waxy ointment. The dung of
asses as well as horses staunches bleeding (whether used
raw or burnt) mixed with vinegar. Dung of one of the
drove that goes at grass (after it is dry) is steeped in wine
and taken as a drink to considerably help those bitten by
scorpions. Doves’ dung (being more hot and burning) is
effective mixed with barley meal, but with vinegar it
dissolves tumours [possibly goitre]. It breaks carbuncles
[infected boils] [ malignant skin tumours], pounded
together with honey and hempseed and oil, and it heals
burns. Poultry dung does the same but less effectively,
yet in particular it is good (taken in a drink with vinegar
or wine) as an antidote against deadly mushrooms and
the suffering of coli [colic]. Dung of a stork (taken in a
drink with water) is thought to be good for epilepsy.
Inhaled, the smoke of the dung of a vulture is reported to
be an abortifacient. The dung of mice (pounded into
small pieces with vinegar and rubbed on) cures baldness.
 223
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

Taken as a drink with frankincense and honeyed wine it
expels urinary stones. Mouse dung given to children [as a 
suppository] encourages the bowels to evacuate. Dog
dung that is taken up in the heat of the dog days
[midsummer], dried, and taken in a drink with water or
wine, is an astringent for the bowels. That of men
(new-made, applied as a poultice) keeps wounds from
inflaming; and it closes open cuts and joins them
together. Dried and rubbed on with honey it is reported
to help those troubled with tonsillitis. The dung of an
earth crocodile is good for women to colour the face and
make it shine. The best is smallest and soon crumbled,
smooth as amyl [starch] and quickly melted in liquid.
Pounded, it is somewhat sour, resembling fermented
dough in the smell. They counterfeit it by feeding
starlings with rice and selling their dung because it is
similar. Others mix amyl [starch] or cymolia [cimolite —
soft earth — hydrous silicate of alumina], colour it with
anchusa, sift it finely through a thin sieve, dry it until it
looks like little worms and sell it instead of this. (It is
found among secrets that man’s dung as well as dogs’
dung mixed with honey and applied to the throat is a
remedy for tonsillitis.) 
2-99. PERI OURON
Urine — CAUTION
A man’s own water (taken as a drink) is an antidote
against viper bites, deadly medicines and dropsy as
it begins. And it is applied with hot cloths for the bites of
sea vipers, sea scorpions, and sea dragons [2-15]. Dogs’
urine makes a warm pack for those bitten by mad dogs,
and with saltpetre [potassium nitrate] it cleans leprosy
and itchiness. Older urine is a better cleanser for achor
[scaly eruption of the scalp], dandruff, psoriasis and hot
eruptions, and it represses gangrenous ulcerations, even
those in the genitals. Put into purulent ears it represses
their pus; and boiled in a pomegranate rind it dries out
worms in the ears. The urine of an incorrupt boy (sipped)
is good for asthma; and boiled in brass with honey it
cleans the scar of a healed wound, argemae [small white
ulcers on the cornea], and dim vision. The same urine
with cyprian brass makes a glue for soldering gold
 224
FATS 

together. The substance of the urine (rubbed on)
alleviates erysipela [streptococcal skin infection]. It eases
pains of the womb boiled with cyprinum [1-65] and
applied. It eases those troubled with constriction of the
womb, cleans the eyelids, and purges scars in the eyes.
Bull’s urine pounded together with myrrh and dropped
in the ears lessens earache. Boar’s urine has a similar
property— more particularly, taken as a drink it breaks
and expels stones in the bladder. Two cups of urine of a
goat taken in a drink with spica nardi  [spikenard] with
water every day (is said) to expel urine through the
bowels, and dropped in the ears it cures sores of the ears.
Urine of an ass is said to cure inflamed kidneys. 
2-100. LUNGOURION
 Lyncurium — Urine of a Lynx
Lyncurium [urine of a lynx] is thought (as soon as it is
pissed out) to grow into a stone, as a result it has only
a foolish report. Some call this succinum pterygophoron [the 
wing of accompaniment] because it draws feathers to it.
Taken as a drink with water it is good for a stomach and 
intestines troubled with excessive discharge. 
2-101. MELI
SUGGESTED: Honey
Attic [Athenian] honey is the best, especially that
called hymettium; the next best is that from the
Cyclad Islands, and that from Sicily called simblium. The
most appreciated is extremely sweet and sharp, with a
fragrant smell, a pale yellow colour, not liquid but
glutinous and firm, and which when taken (as it were)
leaps back to the finger. It is cleansing, opens pores, and
draws out fluids. As a result it is good for all rotten and
hollow ulcers when infused. Boiled and applied it heals
flesh that stands separated, and it cures lichen [ skin
disease with red pustules] boiled with liquid allom
[5-123] and applied; as well as noise in the ears and their
pains, dropped in lukewarm with salt dug up or mined
sea shells pounded into small pieces. Rubbed on it kills
lice and nits, and restores the exposed nut of the yard [old 
 225
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

English — rod, penis] which was opened by
circumcision, the foreskin being softened with honey
(especially after bathing) for thirty days. It cleans away
things that darken the pupils of the eyes. It heals
inflammations around the throat and tonsils, and
tonsillitis, either rubbed on or gargled. It induces the
movement of urine, and cures coughs and those bitten by 
snakes. Taken warm with rosaceum [1-53] it is an antidote
for meconium [4-65]; and is either licked or taken in a drink 
for fungi and those bitten by mad dogs. Raw [honey]
inflates the intestines and encourages coughs — as a
result you ought to use clarified [honey]. Spring honey is
the best, then that of summer, but that of winter (being
thicker) is the worst, causing weals and blisters.
2-102. MELI SARDOON
SUGGESTED: Sardinian Honey
The honey that is made in Sardinia is bitter because
the bees feed on wormwood [3-26] yet it is good
rubbed on the face for sunburn and spots. 
2-103. MELI PONTIKON
SUGGESTED: Heraclean Honey 
At some times (of the year) honey is made in Heraclea
of Pontus which, from the property of certain
flowers, makes eaters of it beside themselves with
sweating, but they are helped by eating rue [3-52, 3-53,
4-98] and salt meat and drinking mead [honey wine],
taking these as often as they vomit. It is sharp and the
smell causes sneezing. Rubbed on with costum [1-15] it
heals sunburn, and with salt it takes away bruises. 
2-104. SAKCHARON
SUGGESTED: Arundo saccharifera, Saccharum officinale, 
Bambusa arundinacea — Sugar Reeds
There is a kind of coalesced honey called sugar found
in reeds in India and Arabia the happy, similar in
consistency to salt and brittle [enough] to be broken
 226
FATS 

between the teeth like salt. It is good dissolved in water
for the intestines and stomach, and taken as a drink to
help a painful bladder and kidneys. Rubbed on it
disperses things which darken the pupils. 
2-105. KEROS
 SUGGESTED: Beeswax
The best wax is a pale yellow, somewhat fat, with a
sweet taste and having the scent as it were of honey,
yet pure. It is usually either Pontic or Cretan. The next
best is somewhat white and fat. Wax is made white as
follows. Cut clean wax into small pieces, put it into a new
jar and pour on it as much sea water (taken out of the
deep) as shall be sufficient, and boil it, sprinkling a little
saltpetre [potassium nitrate] on it. When it has boiled two 
or three times remove the jar, let it cool, take out the calce
[lime] and scrape off the filth if there is any around it, and
boil it again, adding more fresh seawater to it. When the
wax has boiled again (as before) remove the jar from the
fire, take the bottom of a new little jar (first moistened in
cold water), let it down gently into the wax, dipping it in a 
little with a soft touch, that a little of it may be taken, and
that it may be coalesced together separately. Having
taken it up, pull off the first cake and let down the bottom
of the jar again, cooling it in water again, and do this until
you have taken up all the wax. Then pierce the little cakes 
with a linen thread and hang them up at some distance
from one another. In the daytime set them in the sun,
sprinkle them every now and then with water, and at
night set them under the moon until they become
perfectly white. If anyone wants to make it
extraordinarily white let him do these things in the same
way but let him boil it more often. Some, instead of sea
water taken out of the deep, boil it as previously
described once or twice in very sharp brine, then
afterwards they take it out on a thin, round bottle with a
handle. Afterwards, laying the little round cakes on thick
grass, they place them in the sun until at last they become
wonderfully white. They advise to set about this work in
the spring when the sun both lessens its intensity and
yields dew, so that the wax does not melt. All wax is
warming, softening and reasonably filling. It is mixed in
 227
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

broths for dysentery, and is swallowed down in an
amount equal to ten grains of millet, as it does not allow
the milk to curdle in those who suckle [breastfeeding]. 
2-106. PROPOLIS
SUGGESTED: Bee-glue 
The yellow bee-glue that has a sweet scent and
resembles styrax [1-79] should be chosen, and which
is soft, excessively dry, and easy to spread (like mastic
[1-90]). It is extremely warm and attractive, and draws
out thorns and splinters. The smoke from it (inhaled)
helps old coughs, and it is applied to take away lichen
[skin disease with red pustules]. It is found around the
mouths of hives, being similar in nature to wax.

SUGGESTED: Tritici primum genus, Triticum vulgare [Fuchs]
 Triticum sativum, Triticum aesetivum, Triticum tertium genus
[Fuchs], Triticum turegidum [Linnaeus] — Wheat
[other usage] Pirum, Pyrum, Puroi — Pear Tree [Pliny]
The most effective pyrum [wheat] for the preservation
of health is new, fully ripe and a yellowish colour.
Then after this is trimestre [called this because it is ripe in
three months] called by some sitanium, which eaten raw
breeds worms in the loins [lower torso]. Chewed and
applied it helps those bitten by a mad dog. Bread made of
the flour of it is more nourishing than the panis cibarius
[from the merchants] but that from the meal of trimestris
is lighter and quickly distributed. 
Wheat meal is applied as a plaster with juice of
hyoscyamus [4-69] for discharges of the nerves and puffing 
up of the bowels; with vinegar and honey it takes away
freckles. Bran boiled with sharp vinegar and applied as a
warm poultice removes leprosy, and is a convenient
poultice for all inflammations as they begin. Boiled with a 
decoction of rue it represses swelling breasts, and is good
for those bitten by vipers, or troubled with griping. The
fermented dough of the meal (being warming and
extractive) effectively lessens calluses in the soles of the
feet. It ripens and opens other protuberances and boils or
inflammatory tumours with salt. Meal from sitanian
wheat is good applied as a poultice with vinegar or wine
for those bitten by venomous creatures. Boiled like glue
and taken as linctus [syrup] it helps those who spit blood.
It is good against coughs and irritations of the arteries
boiled together with mint and butter. Wheat flour boiled
with honey and water, or oil mixed with water, dissolves
any inflammation. Bread (either raw or baked) applied
with honey and water lessens all inflammation, is very
softening, and somewhat cooling, mixed with some
herbs or juices. Both by itself or mixed with other things,
wheat that is old and dry stops loose bowels. Wheat that
is new (steeped in brine and applied) cures old lichen
[papular skin disease]. Glue made either of fine flour or
 229
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

the finest meal for gluing books, is good for those who
spit blood, if it is made more liquid and lukewarm and a
spoonful is sipped up. 
2-108. KRITHE
SUGGESTED: Hordeum polystichum, Hordeum distichum [Fuchs],
Hordeum distichon [Brunfels, Linnaeus], 
Hordeum tetrastichum [in Sprague] — Two-row Barley
 Hordeum sativum, Hordeum vulgare — Six-row Barley
see 2-157, Crithmum maritimum
The best crithe is is white and clean but it is less
nourishing than wheat; yet crithe water is more
nourishing than the polenta that is made of it by reason of 
the cream that comes off it in the boiling. It is good for
irritations, roughness of the arteries and ulcers. Wheat
water is also good for these things as it is more nourishing 
and diuretic. It causes an abundance of milk
[breastfeeding] boiled together with marathrum [3-81]
seed and sipped. It is urinary, cleansing, flatulent, bad for
the stomach, and ripens oedema. Meal of it boiled with
figs, honey and water dissolves oedema and
inflammation. It digests hard lumps with pitch, rosin and
doves’ dung. It brings ease to those troubled with pain in
their side with melilot [3-48] and the heads of poppies. It is 
applied as a poultice with flax seed, fenugreek and rue
[3-52, 3-53, 4-98] against gaseousness in the intestines.
With moist pitch, wax, the urine of an uncorrupted child
and oil it ripens scrofulous tumours [glandular swelling,
goitres]. With myrtle, wine, wild pears, bramble, or
pomegranate rinds it stops discharges of the bowels.
With quinces or vinegar it is good for gouty
inflammation. Boiled with sharp vinegar (as a poultice
made of crithe meal) and applied warm it cures leprosy.
Juice extracted out of the meal with water and boiled
with pitch and oil is good for discharges of the joints.
Meal of crithe stops discharges of the bowels and lessens
inflammation.

2-109. ZUTHOS 
SUGGESTED: Zythum, Hordeum sativum, Hordeum vulgare
[Pliny] — Soured Barley Water, Egyptian Malt Liquor 
Zythum is made from barley. It is diuretic but hurtful
to the kidneys and nerves (being especially bad for
the neural membrane). It is also wind inducing, produces
bad fluids, and causes leprosy. Ivory steeped in it is made
fit to work on.
2-110. KOURMI 
SUGGESTED:  Hordeum sativum, Hordeum vulgare 
— Fermented Barley Drink 
Adrink is made from barley, called curmi, which
people often drink instead of wine. It causes
headaches, breeds ill fluids, and hurts the tendons. There
are similar sorts of drink made from wheat in western
Iberia and in Brittany. 
2-111. ZEIA
SUGGESTED: Zeae alterum genus [Fuchs], Zea briza dicta, 
Zea monococcus germanica [Brunfels], Triticum monococcum
— Small Spelt, Engrain, One-grained Wheat 
Zeae primum genus [Fuchs], Zeae dicoccus major [Bauhin]
Triticum dicoccum — Emmer Wheat, Two-grained Wheat 
Triticum zea, Triticum spelta — Spelt Wheat, Dinkel Wheat 
There are two kinds of zea — one single and the other
dicoccous, having the seed joined in two husks. It is
more nourishing than barley, pleasant-tasting to the
mouth, but made into bread it is less nourishing than
wheat.

Dinkel Wheat  
 Triticum dicoccum — Emmer Wheat, Two-grained Wheat 
 Triticum vulgare, Triticum sativum, Triticum aesetivum 
— Wheat 
Crimnum from which porridge is made is the coarsest
meal that is made from zea and wheat. It is
abundantly nourishing and easy to digest, but that from
zea is more astringent to the bowels, especially dried by
the fire beforehand. 
2-113. OLURA 
SUGGESTED: Olyra, Spelta, Triticum romanum [Bedevian]
Olyra [grain] is very similar to zea but somewhat less
nourishing. It is also made into bread and crimnum
[porridge] is similarly made of it. 
2-114. ATHERA
SUGGESTED: Triticum zea, Triticum spelta — Alica,
 Spelt Wheat, Dinkel Wheat 
 Triticum dicoccum — Emmer Wheat, Two-grained Wheat 
Athera is made of zea ground very small. It is a spoon-
meal (similar to liquid porridge) suitable for
children, and it is good in plasters. 
2-115. TRAGOS
SUGGESTED: Tragus berteronianus — Carrot Seed Grass 
Tragus is somewhat similar in shape to chondrus
[below] but is much less nourishing than zea [above]
because it has much chaff. As a result it is hard to digest
and softens the bowels.

Bromus is a grass similar to wheat in the leaves,
distinguished by knots, and it has fruit on the top (as
it were, two-footed little locusts) in which is the seed, as
effective for poultices as barley. Porridge is also made
from it for binding the intestines. Cream of bromus is
sipped to help those troubled with a cough. 
2-117. ORUZA
SUGGESTED: Oryza sativa — Rice 
Oryza is a kind of grass growing in marshy and moist
places, moderately nourishing and binding to the
bowels. 
2-118. CHONDROS
SUGGESTED:Triticum zea, Triticum spelta — Spelt Wheat,
Dinkel Wheat  
 Triticum dicoccum — Emmer Wheat, Two-grained Wheat 
Chondrus is made of grain called zea dicoccos , more
nourishing than rice, and more binding to the
intestines, but far better for the stomach. Boiled with
vinegar it takes away leprosy; and rubbed on it drives
away pitted nails, cures aegilopses [ulcer or fistula in the
inner angle of the eye] that are new, and a decoction of it
is a fit suppository for those who have dysentery with
much pain.

— Small Millet, Barnyard Grass, Cockspur Panicum 
 Panicum miliaceum [Linnaeus] — Millet, Panic Millet
Setaria italica, Chaetochloa italica — Italian Millet
[other usage] Cenchrus lappaceus — Bur Cenchrus 
Cenchrus (which the Romans call millet) is less
nourishing than other grains, but made into bread
(or used as porridge) it stops discharges of the intestines
and induces the passing of urine. Heated and put warm
into bags [as a hot pad] it helps griping and other
disorders. 
2-120. ELUMOS 
SUGGESTED: Panicum [Fuchs], Setaria italica [in Sprague]
[other usage] Lyme Grass, Marram, Mat Grass 
— Elymus arenarius
Elymus is of grain seeds similar to millet which are
made into meal in the same way, and are effective for 
the same uses, yet are less nourishing than millet and less
astringent. The Romans call it panicum, and others call it
melinen.
2-121. SESAMON
SUGGESTED: Sesamum indicum, Sesamum orientale, 
Sesamum oleiferum — Sesame seeds, Gingelly, Gingili
Sesamum is hurtful to the stomach and causes a
stinking breath in the mouth, if after it is eaten it
remains between the teeth. Applied it disperses
thicknesses in the nerves. It heals fractures, inflammation 
in the ears, burns, disorders of the colon, and the bites of
the horned viper. With rosaceum [1-53] it eases headaches
caused by heat. The herb boiled in wine does the same. It
is especially good for inflammation and sores of the eyes.
Oil is made [from the seeds] of it that the Egyptians use.

[other usage] Molinia caerulea, Aira coerulea 
— Purple Molinia, Lavender Grass, Blawing Grass 
see 2-116
Aira (which grows among wheat) ground up has the
power to remove the edges from nomae [ grazer
disease, eats away muscle, tissue and bones], rotten
ulcers, and gangrene, applied as a poultice with radishes
and salt. With natural sulphur and vinegar it cures wild
lichenae [skin disease] and leprosy. Boiled in wine with
pigeons’ dung and flaxseed it dissolves scrofulous
tumours [glandular swelling, goitres], and breaks open
swellings that are hard to ripen. Boiled with honey and
water and applied as a poultice it is good for those with
sciatica. The smoke inhaled with polenta, myrrh [1-77,
1-73, 4-116], saffron, or frankincense helps conception.
The Romans call it lolium, and it is also called thyaron.
2-123. AMULON
SUGGESTED: Starch, Amyl
Amyl is called this because it is made without the help
of a mill. The best is made of that wheat which
ripens in three months and grows in Crete or Egypt. It is
made from this clean three-months wheat [ sitanium or
trimestre] being steeped in water five times a day, and if it
is possible in the night too. When it has become soft you
must pour out the water gently without jogging so that
the best starch is not poured out together with it. When it
appears to be very soft (having poured out the water) it
must be trod with the feet, and having poured in (other)
water again it must be pounded. Then the bran that lies
underneath must be taken away with a skimmer, and
that which is left must be strained, and after it is strained
you are to dry it on new tiles in a very warm sun, for if it
remains moist even a little it presently grows sour. It is
effective against discharges of the eyes, hollow ulcers and 
pustules. Taken in a drink it stops the throwing-up of
 239
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

blood, as well as disorders of the arteries. It is mixed with
milk and sauces. Starch is also made from zea [Triticum
zea] that is steeped for one or two days, kneaded with the
hands like dough, and dried in a very hot sun (as has
been formerly described). This is not fit for bodily use but
for other uses it is fit enough.

SUGGESTED: Foenograecum, Foenumgraecum [Fuchs],
Foenumgraecum sativum [Bauhin],
Trigonella foenum-graecum [Linnaeus] —  Fenugreek 
Telis [flour of fenugreek] and meal of fenugreek are
softening and dispersing. Pounded into small pieces
with boiled honey and water and applied as a poultice, it
is good for both inner and outer inflammation. Pounded
into small pieces and applied as a plaster with saltpetre
[potassium nitrate] and vinegar it reduces the spleen. A
decoction of it is a bath for women’s problems caused
either from inflammation or closure (of the vulva). The
cream of it (boiled in water and strained out) cleans hair,
dandruff and scaly eruptions on the scalp. It is inserted
instead of a pessary with goose grease, softening and
dilating the places about the womb. With vinegar the
green leaves are good for weak and ulcerated places. A
decoction is used for ineffective straining at stools or
urination, and for stinking loose bowels from dysentery.
The oil (with myrtle) cleans hair and scars in the private
parts.
It is also called carpon, buceras, aegoceras, ceraitis, or
lotos, the Latins call it foenumgraecum, and the Egyptians,
itasin.
2-125. LINON
SUGGESTED: Linum sativum [Bauhin],
  Linum usitatissimum — Flax 
Linum [flax] is commonly known. The seed (boiled
with honey and oil and a little water, or taken in
boiled honey) has the same strength as fenugreek,
dispersing and softening all inflammation inwardly and
outwardly. Used raw (applied as a plaster with saltpetre
[potassium nitrate] and figs) it takes away sunburn and
varicose veins. With lye it disperses inflammation of the
parotid gland and hard lumps. Boiled with wine it cleans
away herpes [ viral skin infection] and favus [ contagious
 243
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

skin disease]. It takes off pitted nails, taken with an equal
amount of nasturtium [2-185] and honey. Taken with
honey instead of syrup, it brings up things from the chest
and it relieves coughs. Mixed with honey and pepper
into a flat cake and eaten, it encourages the pursuit of
sexual pleasure [ aphrodisiac]. A decoction is given as a
suppository for ulcers of the bowels and womb, as well as
for expelling excrement; and it is very good (like a
decoction of fenugreek) used as a hip bath for
inflammation of the womb. It is also called linocalamis,
anion, or linon agrion; the Romans call it linomyrum, and
the Africans, zeraphis.

Cicer arietinum [Linnaeus] — Chick-pea, Gram
 Astragalus cicer, Phaca cicer — Mountain Chickpea, Vetch 
Erebus — God of the Underworld
Cicer that is set or sown is agreeable to the stomach,
diuretic, causes winds and a good colour all around,
expels the menstrual flow, is an abortifacient, and
encourages milk. It is applied as a poultice (especially
boiled with ervum [2-129, 2-131]) for inflammation from
stones [ urinary, kidney], protruding warts, scabs,
running ulcers of the head, and for lichenae [skin disease],
and cancerous malignant ulcers with barley and honey.
The other type is called arietinus and both of them are
diuretic, a decoction being given with libanotis
[medicated drinks] for yellow jaundice and dropsy; but
they hurt an ulcerated bladder and the kidneys. Some
touch the top of every wart with a cicer  when the moon is
new, some with one, some with another, bind them up in
a linen cloth and command them to be put backward, as
though the warts would fall away by these means. There
is also a wild cicer with leaves similar to that which is set
or sown, sharp in smell but different in the seed,
serviceable for the same uses as the set plants.

Cyamus. The Greek bean is windy, flatulent, hard to
digest, and causes troublesome dreams. Yet it is
good for coughs and gaining body weight, as it is in the
midst of hot and cold. Boiled with vinegar and honey and 
eaten with the husks it stops dysentery and discharges of
the coeliac [ intestinal complaints]; and eaten it is good
against vomiting. It is made less flatulent if the first water
in which it was boiled is thrown away. Green [raw] beans
are worse for the stomach and more wind inducing. Meal 
from the bean (applied as a poultice either by itself or
with polenta) lessens inflammation from a stroke, makes
scars all one colour, helps swollen inflamed breasts, and
dries up milk. With honey and meal of fenugreek it
dissolves boils or inflammatory tumours, parotid
tumours, and blueness under the eyes. With roses,
frankincense and the white of an egg it represses the
falling-forwards of the eyes, staphylomata [inflammatory
protrusion of the cornea] and oedema. Kneaded with
wine it helps excessive liquids and blows to the eyes.
Chewed without the husks, it is applied to the forehead
as a coolant for discharges. Boiled in wine it cures the
inflammation of stones [ urinary, kidney]. Applied as a
poultice to the place where the pubic hair grows in
children, it keeps them hairless for a long time. It cleans
vitiligines [form of leprosy]. If the husks are applied as a
poultice it makes hair that has been plucked grow out
emaciated and thin. Applied with polenta, alumen [5-123]
and old oil it dissolves scrofulous tumours [ glandular
swelling]. A decoction of it dyes wool. It is applied to
discharges of blood caused by leeches, shelled and
divided in two parts as it grew. The cut half closely
pressed on suppresses it.

The Egyptian bean (which some call pontican) grows
abundantly in Egypt, Asia and Cilicia, and is found in 
marshy places. It has a leaf as great as a hat, a stalk the
height of a foot, about the thickness of a finger. The
flower is a rose colour, twice as big as the flower of a
poppy. Having done blowing it bears pods similar to little 
bags, in each of which is a little bean (standing out above
the covering) similar to a little bladder. It is called ciborium
or cibotium (as we should say, loculamentum) because the
setting of the bean is made when it is put in moist land
and so left in the water. The root is thicker than that of the 
reed and lies underneath. This is used either boiled or
raw and is called collocasia. The bean itself is also eaten
green, but when dry it grows black and is bigger than the
Greek one, astringent, and good for the stomach. As a
result the meal that is made from them, sprinkled on
instead of polenta, is good for dysentery and the
abdominal cavity, and it is given as a porridge. The husks
work better boiled in mulsum [honey, water and wine]
and three cupfuls of it given to drink. The green in the
middle of them is bitter to taste, and good for earache,
pounded into small pieces, boiled with rosaceum [1-53]

[4-64] which is sprinkled on meats. The vinegar must be
carefully boiled with it otherwise it troubles the bowels.
Thirty grains of lentils (pilled and swallowed) help a
churning stomach. Boiled and re-boiled with polenta and 
applied, it lessens gout. With honey it joins together the
hollowness of sores, breaks the scabs of ulcers and cleans
them. Boiled with vinegar it disperses hard lumps and
scrofulous tumours [ glandular swelling, goitres]. With
melilot [3-48] or the fruit of cotonea (and rosaceum [1-53]
mixed with it all) it heals inflammation of the eyes and
the perineum. For a worse inflammation of the perineum
and large hollow sores, it is boiled with pomegranate
rinds or dry roses as well as honey. It is good with
seawater for ulcers of the cheek that have become
gangrenous. It is good taken as previously described for
shingles [ herpes], pustules, erysipela [ streptococcal skin
infection] and chilblains. Boiled in seawater and applied
it helps swollen breasts and curdling milk in women’s
breasts.

SUGGESTED: Phasiolus, Isopyron, Isopyrum, Phaseolites,
Phaseolus, Phasel [Pliny], Phaseolus lunatus [Linnaeus in
Mabberley] — Pulses
[other usage] Phaseolus vulgaris, Phaseolus coccineus
— French Beans, Kidney Beans, Scarlet Runner Beans, 
Haricot Beans

Phasiolus is flatulent, stirs up wind, and is hard to
digest. Boiled green and eaten, it softens the bowels
but is apt to make one vomit.
2-131. OROBOS
SUGGESTED: Ervum sativum, Ervum album sativum [Fuchs]
Lathyris sativus [Bauhin, Linnaeus], Ervum sylvestre,
 Lathyris sylvestris [in Sprague] — Indian Pea, Riga Pea, 
Dogtooth Pea [Mabberley] causes motorneurone disease
[other usage] Orobus tuberosus — Orobe, Bitter Vetch 
Orobos (which the Latins call ervum) is a little well-
known shrub with narrow thin leaves, bearing little 
seeds in the husks from which a meal is made called
ervina that is fit for bodily uses. If it is eaten it annoys the
head, troubles the bowels, and brings out blood through
the urine. It fattens beasts if it is boiled and given to them.
Ervina flour is made as follows. Select the fullest and
whitest seeds, sprinkle them with water and stir them
together. When you have allowed them to absorb
enough water, dry them until their husks are quite
broken. Then grind them, sift them through a fine sieve
and put the flour in storage. It is good for the bowels,
diuretic, and causes a good colour. Taken excessively
either in meat or drink it brings out blood through the
intestines and bladder (with suffering). With honey it
cleans ulcers, freckles, sunburn, spots, and the rest of the
body. It stops ulcers of the cheeks, scleroma [hardened
nasal or laryngeal tissue patches], and gangrene. It
softens hard lumps in the breasts, and emarginates

skin disease]. Kneaded with wine and applied it cures the 
bites of dogs, bites of men, and of vipers; with vinegar it
lessens painful frequent urination, griping, and
ineffective straining at stool or urination. Toasted and
taken with honey (in the amount of a nut) it is good for
those whose meat does not nourish them. A decoction
applied with hot cloths cures chilblains and itchiness on
the body.
2-132. THERMOS EMEROS
SUGGESTED: Lupinus albus [Fuchs, Linnaeus], Lupinus termis
 — Egyptian Lupin, Termus
Thermus which is sown is commonly known. The meal
of it taken as a linctus [syrup] with honey (or as a
drink with vinegar) expels worms; and the lupins
themselves steeped and eaten bitter does the same, as
well as a decoction of them taken as a drink with rue
[3-52, 3-53, 4-98] and pepper. This also helps the splenetic. 
It is good as a warm pack for gangrene, wild ulcers, scabs
that are new, vitiligines [type of leprosy], spots, rashes
such as measles, and running ulcers on the head. The
same given in a pessary with myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116] and 
honey extracts the menstrual flow and is an abortifacient. 
The meal cleans the skin and its bruises, and with polenta 
and water it lessens inflammation. With vinegar it lessens 
the pains of sciatica and swellings. Boiled in vinegar and
applied as a poultice it induces passing of scrofulous
tumours [glandular swelling, goitres] out of their place,
and breaks carbuncles [infected boils] [ malignant skin
tumours] all around. Lupines (boiled with rain water
until they cream) clear the face, and boiled with the root
of black chamaeleon [3-11] they cure scabs on sheep
[veterinary] that are washed with a lukewarm decoction
of it. The root boiled with water and taken as a drink
expels urine. The lupines themselves sweetened,
pounded into small pieces and taken as a drink with
vinegar soothe a nauseous stomach and cure lack of
appetite. The Latins call it lupinus, the Egyptians, brechu.

2-133. THERMOS AGRIOS
SUGGESTED: Lupinus angustifolius — Wild Lupin
There is a wild lupin that the Latins call lupinus
agrestis, similar to that which is sown, yet it is in
every way less effective for the same purposes than the
sown lupin.
2-134. GONGULIS 
SUGGESTED: Rapum sativum, Rapum sativum album [Fuchs],
Gongulis [Latin], Brassica rapa — Rape, Common Turnip 
Brassica napus — Naphew, Nape, Winter Rape, Swede 
The boiled root of gongule is nourishing yet very
windy. It breeds moist loose flesh and encourages
sexual appetite [aphrodisiac]. A decoction makes a warm
pack for gout and chilblains. Used alone, pounded into
small pieces and applied, it is good for the same things
too. If anyone makes the root hollow and melts a waxy
ointment of oil of roses in there in hot ashes, this is
effective for ulcerated chilblains. The tender tops are
eaten boiled and they encourage urine [ diuretic]. The
seed is good in antidotes and treacles that stop pain.
Taken as a drink it is good against deadly medicines
[antidote] and encourages sexual activity [ aphrodisiac].
Rapum pickled in brine and eaten is less nourishing, yet it 
restores the appetite. It is also called gongilida, or
golgosium; the Romans call it rapum.
2-135. GONGOLE AGRIOE 
SUGGESTED: Rapum sylvestre, Napus-Bunias sylvestris [Fuchs
Plate #99], Barbarea vulgaris — Winter Cress, Yellow Rocket 
 Rapunculus esculentis [Bauhin], Campanula rapunculus
[Linnaeus] — Rampion [Mabberley]
The wild rapum grows in fields, a shrub of two feet
high, bearing many boughs, smooth on the top; [the
root] is the thickness of a finger or more. It bears seed in
husks similar to cups. When the coverings that contain

these are broken they are white within. They are put into
sebaceous treatments for clearing the face and other parts 
of the body, such as those made from the meal of lupins

— Common Sea Rocket
 Bunias erucago, Bunias aspera, Bunias orientalis — Bunias
Bunias and its root (boiled) is wind-inducing and less
nourishing. The seed (taken in a drink beforehand)
makes poisons ineffective. It is mixed with antidotes and
the root is preserved in salt.
2-137. RAPHANIS
SUGGESTED: Raphanus sativus, Radix, Radicula [Fuchs, Brunfels, 
Linnaeus] — Common Cultivated Radish
Radish also breeds wind and heats. It is welcome to
the mouth but not good for the stomach; besides, it
causes belching and is diuretic. It is good for the
intestines if one takes it after meat, helping digestion
more, but eaten beforehand it suspends the meat. Thus it
is good for those who desire to vomit to eat it before meat. 
It also sharpens the senses. Boiled and taken it is good for
those who have had a cough for a long time, and who
breed thick phlegm in their chests. The skin (taken with
vinegar and honey) is stronger to make one vomit, and
good for dropsy. Applied as a poultice it is good for the
splenetic. With honey it stops gangrenous ulceration of
the cheeks, and takes away black and blue marks under
the eyes. It helps those bitten by vipers, and thickens hair
lost from alopecia. With meal of lolium [2-116, 4-140] it
takes off freckles. Eaten or taken in a drink it helps those
strangled from eating mushrooms, and drives down the
 259

menstrual flow. Taken as a drink with vinegar the seed
causes internal ulcers, is diuretic, and reduces the spleen.
Boiled with warm vinegar and honey it serves as a gargle
to help tonsillitis. Taken as a drink with wine it helps bites 
from a horned viper; and smeared on with vinegar it
emarginates [removes the edge of] gangrene powerfully.
It is also called polyides eryngium, the Latins call it radix
nostratis, and the Africans call it thorpath.
2-138. RAPHANOS AGRIA
SUGGESTED: Raphanis sylvestris, Armoracia [Fuchs],
Raphanus rusticanus [Bauhin], Cochlearia armoracia [Linnaeus],
Nasturtium armoracia, Roripa armoracia, Radicula armoracia
Armoracia rusticana — Common Horseradish 
The wild radish (which the Romans call armoracia) has
leaves similar to that which is sown, or rather more
similar to those of lampsana. The root is slender, soft, and
somewhat sharp; both the leaves and root are boiled
instead of vegetables. It is warming, diuretic and
burning.
2-139. SISARON

Sisarum sativum magnum, Sisarum sativum minus [Fuchs],
Pastinaca sativa latifolia, Sisarum Germanorum [Bauhin], 
 Siser, Sisarum, Sium sisarum [Linnaeus, Bedevian], 
Pastinaca sylvestris latifolia, Pastinaca sativa [in Sprague]
— Skirret, Water Parsnip
Siser is commonly known. The root (eaten boiled) is
pleasing to the taste and effective for the stomach. It is 
diuretic and stirs up the appetite.

SUGGESTED: Oxylapathum, Lapatium acutum [Fuchs], 
Rumex obtusifolius [Linnaeus], Lapathum aquaticum
 — Water Sorrel, Water Dock
Oxalis, Acetosa [Fuchs], Acetosa pratensis [Bauhin],
Rumex acetosa [Linnaeus] — Dock, Sorrel [Mabberley]
Lapathum (one sort of it is called oxylapathum) grows in
marshy places. It is hard and somewhat pointed
towards the top, but that in the garden is not similar to
the other. There is a third kind that is wild, small, similar
to plantain, soft, low. There is also a fourth kind called
oxalis, anaxuris, or lapathum, whose leaves are similar to
the wild small lapathum; the stalk is not great; the seed is
pointed, red, and sharp on the stalk and the branches.
The herbs of all of these (boiled) soothe the intestines.
Applied raw as a poultice with rosaceum [1-53] or saffron it 
dissolves the melicerides [encysted tumour with
exudation like honey]. The seed of the wild lapathum,
oxylapathum and oxalis is effective (taken in a drink of
water or wine) for dysentery, abdominal afflictions, a
scorpion strike, and a nauseous stomach. If anyone
drinks it beforehand he shall have no hurt when struck
(by a scorpion). The roots of these boiled with vinegar (or
used raw and applied as a poultice) cures leprosy,
impetigo [skin infection] and rough nails, but you must
first thoroughly rub the place in the sun with nitre
[potassium nitrate — saltpetre] or vinegar. A decoction of
sorrel applied with hot cloths or mixed with a bath
relieves itchiness. It lessens earache and toothache used
as a rinse with liquid from sorrel boiled in wine. Boiled in
wine and applied, they dissolve scrofulous tumours
[glandular swelling], goitres, and swollen parotid glands. 
A decoction boiled in vinegar lessens the spleen. Some
use the roots as an amulet (hanging them around the
neck) for goitre. Pounded into small pieces and applied,
they also stop women’s flows. Boiled with wine and
taken as a drink they help jaundice, break stones in the
bladder, draw out the menstrual flow, and help those
touched by scorpions.

those mentioned above. 
2-142. LAMPSANE
SUGGESTED: Lampsana communis, Lapsana communis

Althea rosea [in Sprague] — Common Mallow
[other usage] Malache [Bedevian] — Wild Ochra
 Hibiscus esculentis, Abelmoschus esculentis
 — Okra, Gombo, Gobbo
Malache that is sown is more fit to be eaten than the
wild. It is bad for the stomach and good for the
bowels, especially the stalks, which are effective for the
intestines and bladder. The raw leaves (chewed with a
little salt and rubbed on with honey) are able to cure an
ulcer in the inner angle of the eye, but when it must be
brought to a scar then it must be used with salt. Rubbed
on it is effective for bee and wasp stings, and if a man is
rubbed with it beforehand (raw, pounded finely with oil)
he remains unstrikable. Applied with urine it cures
running sores on the head and dandruff. The boiled
leaves pounded into small pieces and applied with oil
help burns and erysipela [streptococcal skin infection]. A
decoction of it is a softening bath for the womb, and is fit
in suppositories for pangs of hunger in the intestines, for
the womb, and for the perineum. The broth boiled
together with the roots helps all poisonings, but those
who drink it must continuously vomit it up. It is good for
those bitten by harvest spiders, and it brings out milk.
The seed of the wild lotus is mixed with it and taken as a
drink with wine to lessen disorders of the bladder. The
Latins call it hortensis [of the garden], Pythagoras calls it
anthema, Zoroastrians, diadesma, the Egyptians, chocorten,
the Magi, caprae lien, and others, muris cauda.

sown in gardens. The latter is eaten boiled as a vegetable.
Smeared on either raw or boiled it dissolves
inflammation in bones. The seed (taken in a drink with
honey and water) cures jaundice. It is also called
chrysolachanon, the Latins call it atriplex, and the
Egyptians, ochi.
2-146. KRAMBE EMEROS
SUGGESTED: Brassica tertium genus, Crambe [Fuchs] — Kale 
Gossularia simplici acino, Spinosa sylvestris [Bauhin],
Brassica napus [Linnaeus] — Rape
Crambe that is sown or set is good for the bowels. It is
eaten slightly boiled, for when thoroughly boiled it
is therapeutic for the intestines, and more so that which is 
twice boiled or boiled in lye. Summer crambe is worthless
for the stomach and sharper, and that which grows in
Egypt is inedible in its bitterness. Eaten, it helps the dull-
sighted and those troubled with trembling. Taken after
meat it extinguishes the maladies that come from
gluttony and wine [ hangovers]. The young tendrils are
better for the stomach yet sharper and more diuretic.
Preserved in salt it is bad for the stomach and troubles the 
intestines. The juice (taken raw and swallowed with iris
and saltpetre [potassium nitrate]) softens the intestines.
Taken in a drink with wine it helps those bitten by a
viper. With the meal of fenugreek and vinegar it helps
those with gout in their feet and joints, and applied it is
good for foul or old ulcers. Poured into the nostrils by
itself it purges the head. Taken as a pessary with meal of
lolium [2-116, 4-140] it expels the menstrual flow. The
leaves pounded into small pieces and applied (either
alone or with polenta) are good for any inflammation and 
oedema. They also heal erysipela [ streptococcal skin
infection], epinyctides [ pustules which appear at night]
and psoriasis. With salt they break carbuncles [infected
boils] [ malignant skin tumours] all around. They stop
hair from falling out of the head. Boiled and mixed with
honey they are good against erosive gangrenes. Eaten
raw with vinegar they are good for the splenetic. Chewed 
and the juice swallowed down they restore the loss of the
voice. A decoction (taken as a drink) induces movement
of the bowels and the menstrual flow. The flower applied

seed, especially of cabbage that grows in Egypt, (taken as
a drink) expels worms. It is put into antidotes for the bites
of poisonous snakes. 
It clears the skin on the face and cleans away freckles.
The green stalks burnt together with the roots are mixed
with old swines’ grease and applied to lessen long-lasting 
pains in the side. It is also called crambe cepaea, i.e. garden
brassica, while the Latins call it brassica.
2-147. KRAMBE AGRIA
SUGGESTED: Brassica oleracea — Wild Kale [Mabberley]
Wild crambe (which the Latins call brassica rustica )
grows most commonly in steep coastal places. It is
similar to that which is sown but is whiter, rougher and
bitter. The young tendrils boiled in lye are not unsavoury
in the mouth. The leaves applied as a poultice are able to
seal wounds, and dissolve oedema and inflammation. 
2-148. KRAMBE THALASSIA
SUGGESTED: Crambe maritima — Sea Kale, Sea Cabbage
That which is called sea crambe is altogether different
from the cultivated, with many thin leaves similar to
the round aristolochia. Every one of them springs from
reddish branches out of one stalk (similar to cissus). It has
white juice but not in any great abundance. It is salty to
the taste and somewhat bitter with a fatty substance. The
whole herb is an enemy to the stomach, sharp, and  eaten
boiled excessively loosening to the bowels. Some
(because of its sharpness) boil it together with fat from
rams.  271

SUGGESTED: Beta candida [Fuchs], Beta alba,
 Cicla officinarum [Bauhin], Beta vulgaris — White Beet,
 Swiss Chard
 Beta nigra [Fuchs], Beta rubra vulgaris [Bauhin] — Beetroot
There are two types of great teutlon. The black are
more astringent for the stomach boiled with lens
[lentils] (especially the root), but the white are good for
the intestines. They both have bad juice because of the
saltpetre [potassium nitrate] in them. As a result, the juice 
put into the nostrils with honey purges the head and
helps earache. A decoction of the roots and leaves applied 
with hot cloths cleanses dandruff and the lendes [ loins
(digestive or procreative) and buttocks], and soothes
chilblains. You must rub vitiligines [form of leprosy] and
erosive ulcers with the raw leaves and nitre [saltpetre], as
well as the the scalp for loss of hair on the head but first
shave it. Boiled, they heal rashes such as measles, as well
as burns and erysipela [streptococcal skin infection]. The
Latins call it beta silvatica.

SUGGESTED: Portulaca hortensis [Fuchs], Portulaca latifolia,
Portulaca sativa [Bauhin], Portulaca oleracea [Linnaeus],
Peplo [Italian], Portulaca oleracea var sativa 
— Garden Purslane
[other usage] Andrachne telephoides — False Orpine
 Arbutus andrachne — Greek Strawberry Tree
Andrachne is astringent. Applied with polenta it helps
headaches, inflammation of the eyes, other
(inflammations), burning of the stomach, erysipela
[streptococcal skin infection], and disorders of the
bladder. Eaten, it lessens numbness of the teeth, burning
of the stomach and intestines and their excessive
discharges, helps eroded kidneys and the bladder, and
dissolves the hot desire to sexual union [ anaphrodisiac].
Taken as a drink the juice has similar effects, and is good
in burning fevers. Boiled very well (it is good) for worms

mixed with eye medicines, and is a suppository for
bowels troubled with excessive discharges, or for a
damaged vulva. It provides irrigation [supply of
moisture] with rosaceum [1-53] or oil for headaches that
come from heat. With wine it is a cleansing ointment for
pustules of the head, and is applied with polenta to
wounds growing into gangrene.

SUGGESTED: Portulaca sylvestris [Fuchs, Bauhin],
Portulaca angustifolia [Bauhin], 
Portulaca oleracea var sylvestris [Linnaeus]

Andrachne sylvestris has broader and thicker little
leaves than the andrachne above. It grows in rocky
places (sometimes also in gardens). It has leaves similar to 
those of the olive tree but much smaller yet more
abundant and tender. There are many red stalks
emerging from one root, leaning earthward. Chewed
they are found to have good juice — sticky, and
somewhat salty. It is warming, sharp, and ulcerating, and 
applied with goose grease it dissolves scrofulous tumours 
[glandular swelling, goitres].
It is also called aizoon agrion i.e. sempervivum sylvestre,
or telephium, the Latins (call it) illecebra, some, portulaca,
the Africans, maemoem, the Dacians, lax, and the
Egyptians, mochmutim.

SUGGESTED: Asparagus altilis [Brunfels], 
Asparagus sativa [Bauhin], Asparagus acutifolius,
 Asparagus corruda, Asparagus officinalis var altilis [Linnaeus]
— Asparagus, Sparrow Grass
Aspharagus is also called myon. It grows in rocky
places, a well-known herb, the small stalks of which,
boiled and eaten, soothe the intestines and encourage
urine [diuretic]. A decoction of the roots (taken as a drink) 
helps frequent and painful urination, jaundice, kidney
 275

ailments and hip problems, as well as those bitten by
harvest spiders. Boiled in wine it helps those troubled
with toothache (a decoction being kept on the pained
tooth). The seed (taken in a drink) is good to obtain the
same results. They say that if dogs drink a decoction they
will die. Some have related that if one pounds ram’s
horns in pieces and buries them, asparagus comes up,
which is incredible to me. 
Asparagus is a plant with many branches and many
long leaves similar to marathrum [3-81], with a great
round root that has a knob. The stalks pounded into small 
pieces with white wine lessen disorders of the kidneys.
Taken either boiled or roasted it soothes slow painful
urination and dysentery. The root boiled either in wine
or vinegar lessens dislocations. Boiled with figs and
chickpeas and eaten it cures jaundice, and lessens hip
pains and painful urination. Displayed [like an amulet]
(and a decoction taken as a drink) it makes one barren
and not fit for generation [birth control].

 — Waybread, Greater Plantain 
Plantago minor [Fuchs], Plantago media [Brunfels, Linnaeus]
Plantago angustifolia major [Bauhin] —  Hoary Plantain
Two kinds of arnoglossa are found — one lesser, the
other larger. The smaller sort has narrower leaves,
smaller, softer, smoother and thinner; with an angular
stalk, bending down (as it were) on the ground. The
flowers are pale, with the seed on the top of the stalks.
The bigger kind is more flourishing, broad-leaved, a sort
of an olus [one that is well known]. The stalk is angular,
somewhat red, a foot in height, closed around from the
middle to the top with thin seed. The roots underneath
are tender, rough, white, a finger thick. It grows in
marshes, hedges and moist places. The larger is better for
use. The leaves are drying and astringent. Therefore
rubbed on they work against all malignancies, and
leprous, running, filthy ulcers. They also stop excessive

[pustules which appear only at night]. They form a skin
over old irregular ulcers, and heal chironian [cheiralgia —
pain in the hand or cuts from a surgeon] and hollow
creeks caused by it. They are good applied with salt for
dog bites, burns, inflammation, and parotitis [inflamed
glands, mumps], as well as the inflammation of bones,
scrofulous tumours [ glandular swelling, goitres], and
ulcers of the eyes. The herb (boiled and taken with water

also given boiled with lentils instead of beets. The herb is
also given (boiled) for the dropsy called leucoplegmatia [a
tendency to dropsy] caused by eating dry meats,
however it must be taken while eating the meats. It is also
good given to the epileptic and the asthmatic. The juice of 
the leaves cleans ulcers in the mouth, washed every now
and then with it. With cimolia [like fuller's earth] or
cerussa [white lead ore] it heals skin inflammation, and
helps fistulas [ulcers] poured into them. The juice being
dropped in the ears or mixed in eye salves helps earache
and sores on the eyes, and it is good (taken as a drink) for
bleeding gums and for those who vomit blood. It is good
for dysentery given as an enema or suppository. It is
taken as a drink against consumption.  It is used as a
pessary in wool for constriction of the womb and for a
womb troubled with excessive discharges. The seeds
(taken as a drink in wine) stop discharges of the bowels
and the spitting of blood. The root is boiled and the
mouth is washed with this decoction (or the root is
chewed) to lessen toothache. The root and the leaves are
given in passum [raisin wine] for ulcers in the bladder and
kidneys, but some say that three roots (taken as a drink
with three cupfuls of wine and as much water) help a
fever with recurrent paroxysms, and that four roots
(help) a quartain [with paroxysms every fourth day]
fever. 
Some also use the root as an amulet for scrofulous
tumours [ glandular swelling goitres] to dissolve them.
(The Syrians say that a broth of this and calamint with
honey will cure the paralysed, given on the second and
fourth day until the parascive, (that is the Friday), but
take this as a secret for it is most true and according to
experience).

Anagallis aquatica minor [Bauhin], Veronica beccabunga
[Linnaeus] — Brooklime [Mabberley]
[other usage] Sium latifolium — Water Parsley, Water Parsnip
 Sium falcaria, Sium siculum — Water Parsnip species
Sium aquaticum is a little shrub which is found in the
water — upright, fat, with broad leaves similar to
hipposelinum [3-78], yet somewhat smaller and aromatic
— which is eaten (either boiled or raw) to break stones
[kidney, bladder] and discharge them. Eaten they also
induce the movement of urine, are abortifacient, expel
the menstrual flow, and are good for dysentery.
(Crateuas speaks of it thus: it is a herb like a shrub, little,
with round leaves, bigger than black mint, similar to
eruca [2-170]). It is also called anagallis aquatica, schoenos
aromatica, as well as a sort of juncus odoratus, darenion, or
laver.

The other sisymbrium is a watery herb growing in the
same places as sion [2-154]. It is also called cardamine
because it resembles nasturtium [2-185] in the taste. It has
round leaves at first but when grown they are divided
like those of eruca [2-170]. It is warming and diuretic and
is eaten raw. It takes away freckles and sunburn, applied
at night and wiped away in the morning. Some call it
cardamine [meadow cress], and some, sion.
2-157. KRITHMON
SUGGESTED: Crithmum maritimum, Cachrys maritimum 
— Samphire, Sea Fennel, Peter’s Cress 
Crithmon (also called critamon) is a shrubby little herb
about a foot in height, with thick leaves, which
grows in rocky maritime places. It is full of fat whitish
leaves similar to those of purslane — yet thicker and
longer and salty to the taste. It bears white flowers and a
soft fruit similar to libanotis — sweet smelling, round.
When dry it splits and has a seed within similar to wheat.
The roots are the thickness of a finger, fragrant, and with
a pleasant taste. The seed, root and leaves (boiled in wine
and taken as a drink) are effective to help frequent
painful urination and jaundice, and they induce the
menstrual flow. It is used as a vegetable (eaten either
boiled or raw), and is also preserved in brine.

Coronopus is a little herb that is somewhat long, with
indented leaves, spread on the ground. It is eaten
(boiled) as a vegetable. It has a thin astringent root that is
eaten for coeliac [ intestinal complaints]. It grows in
untilled places, on hillocks and by highways. It is also
called ammonos, or astrion, the Africans call it atirsipte, the
Latins caciatrix, some, stilago, or sanguinaria.
2-159. SONCHOS
AKANTHODESTEROS, SONCHOS

Sonchus non-aspera [Fuchs], Sonchus laevis laciniatus latifolius
[Bauhin], Sonchus oleraceus var laevis [Linnaeus] 
— Sowthistle, Milkthistle [Mabberley]
There are two kinds of sonchus — one more wild and
prickly, the other more tender and edible. The stalk is 
angular and somewhat red within with ragged leaves at a 
distance all around. They are cooling and moderately
astringent; as a result they are applied for a burning
stomach and inflammation. The juice is sipped to lessen
pangs of hunger in the stomach. It draws down milk and
is applied on wool to help inflammation of the perineum
and womb. The herb and root are applied to help those
touched by a scorpion. There is also another kind of
sonchus that is also tender, grows like a tree, and is broad
leaved, but the leaves divide the stalk. This is effective for
the same purposes. It is also called asperum, or cichorium,
the Romans call it cicerbita, and the Africans, gathuonem.

Intybum sylvestre, Intubus erraticus, Cichorea [Fuchs],
Cichorium sylvestre, Cichorium officinarum [Bauhin]
Cichorium intybus [Linnaeus] — Wild Chicory, Succory
Seris has two types — wild and cultivated, of which the 
wild is called pickris or cichorum, but the other kind,
that of the garden, is broader-leaved and more pleasant
in the mouth. Of the two kinds, one is more similar to
lettuce and is broad leaved; the other is narrow-leaved
and bitter. Both are astringent, cooling and good for the
stomach. Boiled and taken with vinegar they stop
discharges of the bowels, and the wild (especially) are
best for the stomach, for when eaten they comfort a
disturbed and burning stomach. Applied with polenta
(or by themselves) they are good for heart conditions.
They help gout and inflammation of the eyes. The herb
and root are rubbed on to help those who are touched by
a scorpion, and with polenta they heal erysipela
[streptococcal skin infection]. The juice from them with
cerussa [white lead ore] and vinegar is good rubbed on
those who need cooling. It is also called picris, the
Egyptians call it agon, and the Romans, intybus agrestis.
2-161. KONDRILLE, KONDRILLE ETERA
SUGGESTED: Hedypnois, Dens leonis, Taraxacon [Fuchs],

Taraxacum officinale — Dandelion
[other usage] Chondrilla juncea, Chondrilla graminea 
— Chondrilla, Chondrille, Gum Succory, Wild Succory
Condrilla (also called cichorium or seris), has leaves, a
stalk and flowers similar to chicory, as a result some
have said that it is a kind of wild seris, but it is altogether
much smaller. Around the stems a gum is found (about
the size of a bean) that is similar to mastic [1-51]. Pounded 
into small pieces with myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116] and an
amount the size of an olive applied in a linen cloth, it

dries out the menstrual flow. The herb pounded together
with the root and mixed with honey is formed into
lozenges, which are diluted and mixed with saltpetre
[potassium nitrate] to take away sunburn. The gum
preserves the hair. The root (taken whilst it is new) is
good for the same purposes — a needle being dipped
[into the juice of] it and applied to the hair. Taken as a
drink with wine it is also good against vipers; and the
juice boiled with wine and taken as a drink (or else taken
alone) stops discharges of the bowels. There is also
another kind of condrilla with a gnawed-around leaf,
somewhat long, scattered on the ground, the stalk full of
juice; and a slender root — lively, smooth, round, a pale
yellow, full of juice. The stalk and the leaves are digestive, 
and the juice is good for retaining the hair on the eyelids.
It grows in fertile and cultivated fields. 
2-162. KOLOKUNTHA
SUGGESTED: Citrullus colocynthis, Cucumis colocynthis 
— Colocynth, Bitter Apple, Bitter Gourd 
see 4-178
The edible colocynth (bruised and applied raw) lessens
oedema and the suppuration of ulcers. Scrapings of it 
are effective applied to the upper part of the heads of
children troubled with heat of the head called siriasis
[sunstroke]; and it is similarly used for inflammations of
the eyes and gout. Juice from bruised scrapings is
dropped in the ears either by itself or with rosaceum [1-53]
to help earache. Rubbed on, it is good for the appearance
of burns from heat. The herb boiled whole and the juice
of it strained out and taken as a drink with a little honey
and nitre [saltpetre] gently loosens the bowels. If you
hollow it (raw), put wine in there, set it out in the open
air, then afterwards dilute it and drink it fasting, it gently
soothes the bowels.

SUGGESTED: Cucumis sativus vulgaris [Fuchs, Bauhin],
Cucurbita maior, Cucurbita oblonga [Fuchs],
Cucurbita lagenaria [Linnaeus], Lagenaria vulgaris,
Sicyos [Latin], Cucumis sativa — Cucumber
The cultivated cucumer is good for the intestines and
the stomach, cooling (if it is not spoiled), effective for
the bladder. It is smelled to revive those in a swoon, and
the seed is mildly diuretic. With milk or passum [raisin
wine] it is good for ulcers of the bladder. The leaves are
applied with wine to heal the bites of dogs; with honey
they heal pustules that appear at night.
2-164. PEPON
SUGGESTED: Pepo, Cucumis pepo [Fuchs], 
Melo vulgaris [Bauhin], Cucumis melo [Linnaeus], Cantalupo,
 Popone [Italian], Cucumis dudaim var aegypticus 
— Sweet Melon, Dudaim Melon 
[other usage] Cucurbita pepo — Pumpkin
 Melopopone [Italian], Cucurbita pepo var melopepo — Squash
The pulp of pepon is diuretic if eaten, but applied it
alleviates inflammation of the eyes. The scrapings
are laid on top of the heads of children troubled with
siriasis [sunstroke]; and it is laid as an anacollema [against
that which is glued together] to the forehead for
rheumatic eyes. The juice together with the seed, mixed
with meal and dried in the sun, is a scourer to purge away 
filth and make the skin on the face clear. A teaspoon of
the dry root (taken as a drink with honey water) causes
vomiting. If anyone wants to vomit gently after supper
two times ten grains will be sufficient for this. It also heals
favus [contagious skin disease] rubbed on with honey.

SUGGESTED: Lactuca sativa crispa et rotunda [Fuchs], 
Lactuca crispa [Bauhin], Lactuca sativa [Linnaeus],
Lactuca scariola var sativa — Common Lettuce
Lactuca (the garden lettuce) is good for the stomach, a
little cooling, causes sleep, softens the bowels and
draws down milk. Boiled, it is more nourishing. Eaten
unwashed it is good for the stomach. The seeds (taken in
a drink) help those who dream continuously, and turn
away sexual intercourse [anaphrodisiac]. Eaten too often
they cause of dullness of sight. They are also preserved in
brine. When they shoot up into a stalk they have
properties similar to the juice and milk of the wild lettuce. 
The Romans call it lactuca, and the Egyptians, embrosi.
2-166. THRIDAX AGRIA
SUGGESTED: Lactuca sylvestris [Fuchs], 
Lactuca scariola [Linnaeus], Thridax [Latin], Lactuca virosa 
— Wild Lettuce 
Wild lettuce is similar to the cultivated only larger-
stalked, paler in the leaves, thinner and sharper,
and bitter to the taste. It is somewhat similar to poppy in
properties, as a result some mix the milky juice of it with
meconium [4-65]. Twenty grains of the juice (taken in a
drink with posca [hot drinks]) purges away watery matter
through the bowels. It also wears off albugo [eye disease],
and mistiness and dimness of the eyes, and it is good
against their burning heat rubbed on with woman’s milk. 
In general it is sleep-inducing and eases pain. It draws
out the menstrual flow, and is given as a drink for those
touched by a scorpion or harvest spider. The seed of this
(as well as the cultivated, taken in a drink) turns away
lustful dreams and venereal diseases. The juice is also
good for the same purposes yet weaker. The milky juice
of it is first exposed to the sun (like other extracted juices)
and stored in new ceramic jars. The Magi call it sanguis
Titani, Zoroastrians, pherumbras, and the Romans, lactuca
sylvestris.

Chaerophyllum sativum [Bauhin], Scandix cerefolium [Linnaeus], 
Anthriscus cerefolium — Chervil [Mabberley]
Gingidium grows plentifully in Cilicia and Syria — a
little herb similar to wild pastinaca yet thinner, and
with a thicker little root, white and bitter. It is used as a
vegetable, eaten both raw and boiled. Pickled, it is good
for the stomach and diuretic. A decoction (taken as a
drink with wine) is good for the bladder. The Romans call 
it bisacutum, the Egyptians, dorysastrum, the Syrians,
adorion, the Africans, tiricta, and it is also called lepidium.
2-168. SKANDUX
SUGGESTED: Anthriscus sylvestris, Scandix [Pliny] 
— Wild Chervil, Cow Parsley, Cow Weed 
Scandix is a wild vegetable — somewhat sharp and
bitter, edible whether eaten raw or boiled, good for
the intestines and the stomach. A decoction (taken as a
drink) is good for the bladder, kidneys, and liver. The
Romans call it herba scanaria, and some, acicula.
2-169. KAUKALIS
SUGGESTED: Caucalis grandiflora, Caucalis pumila,
 Caucalis platycarpus — Caucalis, Hedge Parsley, Bur Parsley 
Caucalis (also called wild daucus) has a little stalk a foot
in length or more, with leaves similar to marathrum
[3-81], very divided and rough, and on the top of it a
white tuft with a fragrant scent. This is also used as a
vegetable (eaten either raw or boiled), and is diuretic.
It is also called caucum, or myitis, Democritus calls it
bryon, the Romans, pes gallinaceum,  some call it pes pulli,
and the Egyptians call it seselis.

 Eruca erucacastrum, Erucacastrum obtusangulum,
 Brassica erucacastrum — Bastard Rocket, Wild Rocket 
Eaten raw in any great amount this encourages the
pursuit of sexual pleasure [aphrodisiac], and the seed 
has a similar effect — also being diuretic, digestive and
good for the bowels. They use the seed in making sauces
so that it may last longer. They steep it first in vinegar or
milk, make it into lozenges, and afterwards place it in
storage. Wild ezymum grows as well especially in Iberia
towards the west, the seed of which the men there use
instead of mustard. It is more diuretic and far sharper
than the cultivated. The Romans call it eruca, the
Egyptians, ethrekicen, and the Africans, asuric.
2-171. OKIMON
SUGGESTED: Ocimum exiguum, Ocimum minutum, 
Ocimum mediocre, Ocimum magnum [Fuchs]
 Ocimum basilicum, Basilicum — Basil, Sweet Basil
Ocimum is commonly known. Eaten much it dulls the 
eyesight and softens the bowels, moves flatulence,
is uretic, and helps the flow of milk. It is hard to digest.
Applied with flour of polenta, rosaceum [1-53] and vinegar 
it helps inflammation, and the strikes of poisonous fishes
and scorpions. Used alone with Chian [from Scios in the
Aegean sea] wine (it is good) for sores of the eyes. The
juice takes away dimness in the eyes, and dries up excess
fluids in them. Taken in a drink the seed is good for those
who breed depression, for frequent painful urination,
and flatulence. It causes considerable sneezing when
smelled, and the herb does the same. The eyes must be
shut whilst the sneezing lasts. Some avoid it and do not

were) two feet [high] and sometimes bigger, fattish in the
leaves, rough, tender, endowed with whitish flowers, or
somewhat inclining to yellow. The root lies underneath,
the thickness of a finger, eaten through with holes when
the stalk dries. It seems that when it grows among pulse
[legumes] it chokes them, from which it has its name. It is
used as a vegetable (either raw or boiled) eaten from a
platter like asparagus. Boiled together with legumes it is
thought to make them boil sooner. It is also called
cynomorion, or leonem, and the Cyprians call it thyrsine.

longer and more widely known, with seeds within
similar to kidneys, not the same colour but partly
somewhat reddish. The fruit (pod) is eaten with the seeds 
as a vegetable, boiled like asparagus. It encourages urine
and causes troublesome dreams.

SUGGESTED: Porrum capitatum [Fuchs], Allium porrum, 
Porrum sectivum, Allium schoenoprasum [Linnaeus],
Porrum commune,  Allium ameloprasum var porrum — Leek
The headed prasum (which the Latins call porrum) is
inflative, has bad juice, causes troublesome dreams,
is uretic and good for the stomach, reduces the intensity
of symptoms, causes dullness of sight, expels the
menstrual flow, and hurts ulcerated bladders and
kidneys. Boiled with barley water (or otherwise eaten) it
brings out things that close up the chest. The blades
boiled in sea water and vinegar are excellent in a bath for
suffocation and hardness of the womb. It grows sweet
and becomes less flatulent if it is boiled in two [separate]
waters and steeped in [fresh] cold water. The seed is
sharper and somewhat astringent. As a result, the juice
mixed with vinegar and manna [exudation of certain
trees] or frankincense, stops the blood (especially that
which comes from the nostrils), discourages venereal
diseases, and is good used as linctus [syrup] with honey
for all disorders in the chest. Eaten (it is good) against
consumption [ wasting disease]. It cleans the breath
canals [lungs]. Eaten frequently it dulls the sight and is
worthless for the stomach. Taken as a drink with honey
and water the juice is a remedy for those bitten by
venomous creatures, and the prasum itself also does good
if applied. The juice dropped in the ears with vinegar,
frankincense, and milk or rosaceum [1-53] helps earache
and noises in the ears. The leaves applied with rhoe [4-64]
obsoniorum [any food which is not bread] take away varos
[papules of smallpox], and heals pustules which appear
at night. Applied with salt it removes the edges on the
crusts of ulcers. Two teaspoonfuls of the seeds (taken in a

throwing-up of old blood.

bowels, open the passages for excrement, and are good
for haemorrhoids. First peeled and put into oil, they are
given as a suppository. The juice rubbed on with honey
helps dull sight, argema [small white ulcer on the cornea],
small clouds in the eye, and those who are beginning to
be troubled with liquids in the eyes, as well as angina
[heart pains]. It both induces and expels the menstrual
flow, and inhaled it purges the head by the nostrils. It is a
poultice with salt, rue [3-52, 3-53, 4-98] and honey for
those bitten by dogs. Thoroughly rubbed on in the sun
with vinegar it cures vitiligines [form of leprosy], and with 
an equal amount of spodium [calcined powder] it lessens
scabby inflammations of the eyes. With salt it represses
varos [smallpox pustules]. With poultry grease it is good
for shoe-chafing, excessive discharges of the intestines,
hardness of hearing, noise in the ears, and purulent ears.
It is also good for dripping water in the ears, and the loss
of hair (rubbed on) as it brings out the hair sooner than
alcyonium [5-136]. Onion (much eaten) causes headaches,
but boiled it becomes more diuretic. If much is eaten in
 307
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

times of sickness it makes men lethargic. Boiled and
applied as a plaster with raisins of the sun or figs it ripens
and breaks swelling sores. It is also called polyides, the
Magi call it calabotis, and the Latins, caepa.
2-182. SKORODON,
LEUKOSKORODON,
OPHIOSKORODON,
ELAPHOSKORODON 
SUGGESTED: Allium hortense, Allium sylvestre, 
Allium ursinum [Fuchs, Linnaeus], Allium sativum,
 Allium vineale, Allium oleraceum, Porrum sativum — Garlic 
Some garlic is cultivated and grows in gardens, and
that in Egypt has only one head like the leek — sweet, 
inclining to a purple colour. Elsewhere it is compacted of
many white cloves that the Greeks call aglithai. There is
another wild kind called ophioscorodon (that is, serpent’s
garlic). It has a sharp, warming, biting quality. It expels
flatulence, disturbs the belly, dries the stomach, causes
thirst and puffing up, breeds boils on the outside of the
body, and dulls vision. Ophioscorodon does the same
things when eaten, as well as elaphoscorodon (as we should 
say, hart’s garlic). Eaten, it draws out broadworms and
draws away urine. It is good like nothing else for those
bitten by vipers or with haemorrhous [women’s excessive
loss of blood] (with wine taken shortly afterwards), or
else pounded into small pieces in wine and taken as a
drink. It is applied as a poultice that is effective for the
same purposes, as well as applied to anyone bitten by a
mad dog. Eaten, it is good against change of waters (to
clear the throat, and the same way to relieve roughness of 
the throat). It clears the arteries, and eaten either raw or
boiled lessens old coughs. Taken as a drink with a
decoction of origanum it kills lice and nits. Burnt and
mixed with honey it cures bruised eyes. It is rubbed on for 
loss of hair but for this it must be used with ointment of
nard [1-6, 1-7, 1-8, 1-10]. With salt and oil it heals erupted
pimples. With honey it takes away vitiligines [form of
leprosy], lichenes [skin disease], freckles, running ulcers
on the head, dandruff, and psoriasis. Boiled with taeda
[pitch pine] and frankincense and kept in the mouth it
lessens toothache. It is a poultice with fig leaves and

cumin for those bitten by the mygale [shrew mouse]. A
decoction of the leaves is a hip bath to bring down the
menstrual flow and afterbirth. It is also inhaled as smoke
for the same purpose. The stamping that is made of it
with black olives called myrton [garlic and olives] induces
the movement of urine, opens the mouths of veins, and is 
good for dropsy. It is also called geboscum, some call it
elaphoboscum, and the Latins, allium.
2-183. SKORODOPRASON
SUGGESTED: Allium scorodoprasum — Spanish Garlic,
 Spanish Shallot 
Scordoprasum grows to the size of a leek, sharing the
qualities of both garlic and leek (from which it has a
mixed kind of strength), performing things that the garlic 
and the leek do, but with fewer efficacies. It is used as a
vegetable, eaten boiled like leek and thus made to
become sweet.
2-184. SINEPI
SUGGESTED: Napy, Sinapis primum genus [Fuchs], 
Sinapi hortense [Brunfels], Sinapis alba [Linnaeus],
Leucosinapis officinalis, Brassica alba — White Mustard,
Salad Mustard, Cultivated Mustard 
Choose sinepi that is not very dry, red or full; but
which if broken looks green within, and as it were
juicy and bluish grey. This sort is new and in its prime. It
is able to warm, thin, and to draw, and is chewed to purge 
phlegm from the head. The juice (mixed with honey
water and gargled) is good for hard swollen tonsils, and
for old, hard, rough skin of the arteries. Pounded into
small pieces and put into the nostrils it causes snivelling,
helps the epileptic, and revives those troubled with
constriction of the vulva. It is rubbed on the lethargic
(their head being first shaved). Mixed with figs and
applied to the place until it becomes red it is good for
sciatica [pains in the hips]. It is used to draw out anything
from deep within to the outside of the body (to cure it) by
diverting the suffering some other way. Rubbed on with
honey, fat or wax ointment it cures loss of hair, cleans the
 311
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

face, and takes away bruises from the eyes. It is rubbed
about with vinegar for leprosy and wild impetigo [ skin
infection]. It is taken in a drink against the circuits of
fevers, being sprinkled on the drink dry (the same as
polenta). It is effective mixed with drawing plasters such
as those made for scabies [itchy parasitical disease]. It is
good pounded with figs and applied for hardness of
hearing and noise in the ears. The juice rubbed on with
honey is good for dullness of sight and rough skin of the
jowls. The juice is pressed out of it whilst the seed is green 
and dried in the sun. It is also called napy, and the
Romans call it sinapi.
2-185. KARDAMON
SUGGESTED: Nasturtium hortense, Nasturtium sativum,
Cressio hortensis [Fuchs, Brunfels], Cardamum,
Nasturtium hortense vulgatum [Bauhin], Lepidium sativum
[Linnaeus], Lepidium oleraceum — Common Garden Cress,
Tongue Grass
The best cress seems to be from Babylon. The seed of
any sort of cress is warming, sharp, bad for the
stomach, troubles the intestines, expels worms, lessens
the spleen, is an abortifacient, moves the menstrual flow,
and incites to copulation [ aphrodisiac]. It has a similar
nature to mustard seed and rocket seed. It cleans away
psoriasis and impetigo [skin infection]. It keeps the spleen
low, rubbed on with honey. It takes away smallpox
pustules, and boiled in sipping drinks brings up things
sticking in the chest. Taken as a drink it is an antidote
against the poison of snakes, and it drives away snakes
with inhalation of the smoke from it. It prevents falling
hair. It brings carbuncles [ infected boils] to suppuration
breaking them all around. It is good for sciatica rubbed on 
with vinegar and polenta. It dissolves oedema and
inflammation, and rubbed on with brine brings boils or
inflammatory tumours to suppuration. The herb does the 
same things as the seed yet it is somewhat less effective. It 
is also called cynocardamom, iberis, cardamina, or
cardamantica; the Egyptians call it semeth, and the Latins,
nasturtium.

SUGGESTED: Thlaspi latifolium [Fuchs],Thlaspi campestre
[Linnaeus], Lepidium campestre [Brunfels] —  Field Cress, 
Wild Bastard Cress, Pepperwort 
[other usage] Thlaspi arvense — Penny Cress,
 Mithridate Mustard, Wild Cress
  Thlaspi alliaceum — Garlic-scented Shepherd’s Purse 
Thlaspi is a little herb, narrow in the leaves, the height
of about a finger, bending to the ground, divided at
the top, somewhat fat. It sends out a little stalk two feet in
height with a few little branches. Around the whole of it
there is fruit from the top, somewhat broad, in which a
little seed is enclosed similar to nasturtium [2-185], shaped 
like a dish as it were, broken or bruised, from which it
took its name. The flowers are somewhat white, and it
grows in paths, on walls, and in hedges. The seed is sharp 
and warming. An acetabulum [vinegar cruet measure]
(taken in a drink) purges bile upward and downward. It
is made into a sup pository for sciatica. Taken in a
drink it brings out blood and breaks internal abscesses. It
induces the menstrual flow and is an abortifacient.
Crateuas mentions another kind of thlaspi called Persicum
sinapi, broad-leaved and big-rooted, and this is also
mixed in suppositories for sciatica. It is also called
thlaspidium, sinapim, sinapi sylvestre , myiten, myopteron,
dasmophon, or bitrum; the Egyptians call it suitempsum, the
Romans, scandulaceum, and it is also called capsella, or pes
gallinaceum.
2-187. DRABA
SUGGESTED: Draba verna [Linnaeus], Europhila vulgaris 
— Common Europhila
  Draba olympica, Draba arabis, Draba nemoralis 
— Witlow Grass 
Draba, a herb of about a foot high, has slender sprigs
with leaves on both sides like lepidium, yet more
tender and paler, and a tuft on the top with white flowers 
similar to elder. This herb is boiled with barley water
(especially in Cappadocia) and the dry seed is mixed with 
sauces instead of pepper.

2-188. ERUSIMON
SUGGESTED: Irion, Sinapis sylvestris, Rapistrum [Fuchs],
Rapistrum flore luteo [Bauhin], Sinapis arvensis [Linnaeus],
Sisymbrium officinale, Erysimum officinale — Hedge Mustard,
Singer’s Plant
[other usage] Erysimum alliaria, Alliaria officinalis 
— Blistercress, Garlicwort 
 Erysimum barbarea, Erysimum cheiranthoides 
— Treacle Mustard, Treacle Wormseed 
Erysimum grows about towns, the yards of houses and
gardens. It has leaves like eruca sylvestris [2-170]. It
has a little stalk, pliable and flexible like a rein, and
flowers of a yellowish colour. On the top are little pods
like horns (as slender as those of fenugreek) in which are
little seeds like those of nasturtium [2-185], burning
according to the taste. Licked in with honey they are
good for excessive discharges of the chest, spitting-up of
rotten stuff, coughs, jaundice and sciatica [pains in hips;
sciatic nerves]. It is taken in a drink against deadly
medicinal drinks [ antidote]. Rubbed on with water or
honey it is good for hidden diseases of the cornea, hard
lumps, glandular tumours, inflammation from stones
[urinary, kidney], and inflammation of the breasts. In
general it thins and warms but it is made milder for
syrups — first steeped in water and dried or bound into a
linen cloth, wrapped around with kneaded flour, and
roasted. ( Erysimum, pounded into small pieces with
wine, should be taken as a drink for pains in the
intestines; and if you put seven grains into a house, there
shall be arguing). It is also called chamaeplion, the Magi call 
it Herculis psoriasista , the Egyptians, erethmu, and the
Romans call it irio.
2-189. PIPER
SUGGESTED: Piper longum, Piper aromaticum, Piper chaba,
 Chaba officinarum, Chaba roxberghii  — Long Pepper 
Piper nigrum  — Black Pepper
Pepper is said to be a short tree that growing in India
which sends out a fruit — at first long, similar to pods 
— which is the long pepper. It has something within it

Piper nigrum

similar to millet, will be perfect pepper. At its time of
opening itself it sends out clusters bearing grains such as
we know (some of which are unripe) which are the white
pepper — especially suitable for eye medicines,
antidotes, and for the bites of poisonous snakes. The long
pepper is endowed with an extraordinarily biting
quality, is somewhat bitter because of being unripe, and
is suitable for antidotes and the bites of poisonous snakes. 
The black is sweeter and sharper than the white, more
pleasant to the mouth, more aromatic because it is ripe,
and fitter to be used in sauces; but the white and unripe is 
weaker. Choose that which is heaviest and full, black, not
too wrinkled, new and not branny. Some is found among
the black — without nourishment, lank and light —
which is called brasma. All pepper in general is warming,
urinary, digestive, attracting and dissolving, and cleans
away things that darken the pupils. It is good (either
taken in a drink or rubbed on) for periodical chills (of
fevers), it helps those bitten by poisonous beasts, and it is
an abortifacient. Applied as a pessary it seems to hinder
conception after sexual intercourse [ birth control]. It is
good (taken either in syrups or liquid medicines) for
suffering about the chest and for coughs. It is good
rubbed on with honey for tonsillitis, and dissolves
griping taken as a drink with tender leaves of laurel.
Chewed with adenoid passae [lozenges] it draws mucus
out of the head. Mixed in sauces it eases pain, is healing,
and encourages appetite. Taken with pitch it dissolves
scrofulous tumours [glandular swelling], and with nitre
[saltpetre] it cleans away vitiligines [type of leprosy]. It is
roasted in a new ceramic jar over coals — being shaken
about similar to lens [lentils]. The root of it is not ginger (as 
some have supposed) as we will show a little later. Yet the 
root of pepper is similar to costus [1-15] — warming the
taste and causing spittle. Rubbed on with vinegar it
humbles the spleen, and chewed with stavesacre [4-156]
it extracts mucus. 
2-190. ZINGIBERI
SUGGESTED: Zingiber officinale — Ginger 
Ginger is a private plant growing plentifully in
primitive Arabia. The green herb is used for many
 319
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

purposes (as we use rue [3-52, 3-53, 4-98], boiling and
mixing it in oil) for drinking, and with boiled meats. It has 
small little roots like those of cyprus [1-124], whitish,
resembling pepper in taste, and with a sweet smell.
Choose those that are least rotten. Some (because of
rotting soon) are preserved and carried into Italy in
ceramic jars and are fit for [use with] meat, but they are
used together with their pickle. They are warming and
digestive, soften the intestines gently, and are good for
the stomach. Ginger root is effective against things that
darken the pupils [eyes]. It is also mixed with antidotes,
and in a general way it resembles pepper in its strength.
2-191. UDROPEPERI
SUGGESTED: Hydropiper [Fuchs], Persicaria urens,
 Persica hydropiper [Bauhin], Polygonum hydropiper [Linnaeus]
— Water Pepper 
SLIGHTLY POISONOUS
Hydropiper grows chiefly near standing waters or
those flowing gently. It sends out a stalk that is
knotty and strong, around which are hollows with
wings; and leaves similar to mint, but bigger, more
delicate and whiter, sharp in taste, similar to pepper but
without any sweet smell. It has a fruit growing on the
little branches near the leaves, hanging close together like 
clusters of grapes, and it is also sharp. The leaves applied
with the seeds are able to dissolve oedema and old hard
lumps, and take away bruises. Dried and pounded, they
are mixed with salt and sauces instead of pepper. It has a
little root that is of no use.
2-192. PTARMIKE
SUGGESTED: Ptarmice, Pyrethrum sylvestre [Fuchs], 
Dracunculis pratensis serrato folio [Bauhin], Achillea ptarmica, 
Achillea macrocephala, Ptarmika vulgaris — Sneezewort, 
Bastard Pellitory 
Ptarmica is a little shrub with many small round
branches similar to southernwood, around which are 
many leaves — somewhat long, similar to those of the
olive tree. On the top is a little head like anthemis arvensis

bruises below the eyes. The flowers induce sneezing
most effectively. It grows in mountainous and rocky
places.

SUGGESTED: Struthium, Saponaria [Fuchs], 
Saponaria major laevis [Bauhin], Saponaria officinalis [Linnaeus]
— Soapwort, Bouncing Bet, Fuller's Herb [Mabberley]
Struthium (which fullers use for cleaning their wool) is
commonly known. The root is sharp and uretic. A
spoonful of it (taken with honey) helps those with liver
disorders, coughs, and asthma; and it draws off bowels.
Taken with panaces [3-55, 3-56, 3-57] and root of capparis
[2-204] it breaks stones [kidney] and voids them by urine,
and melts a hardened spleen; and (placed below) it
draws down the menstrual flow, and is an abortifacient.
Smeared on with polenta and vinegar it takes away
leprosy. Boiled with barley meal and wine it dissolves the
inflammation of bones. It is mixed with eye salves made
for sharpening the sight, and with soothing medicines. It
induces sneezing. Pounded into small pieces and put up
into the nostrils with honey it purges through the mouth. 
It is also called cerdon, catharsis, struthiocamelus, or
chamaerrhytos; the Magi call it chalyriton, the Latins, radix,
or herba lanaria, the Egyptians, oeno, and the Africans call it 
syris.
2-194. KUKLAMINOS
SUGGESTED: Cyclamen cyclaminus, Cyclamen europaem
[Linnaeus], Cyclamen littorale, Cyclamen officinale 
— Cyclamen, Sow Bread, Bleeding Nun
 Cyclamen graecum — Greek Cyclamen
Cyclaminus has leaves like cissus, a purple colour,
varied, with whitish spots beneath and above; a
stalk of four fingers high, bare and naked, on which are
flowers similar to roses, tending to a purple colour; the
root black, very similar to rape [coleseed] root and
 323
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

somewhat broader. Taken as a drink with honey water it
drives phlegm and water [fluids] downwards. It induces
the menstrual flow either taken in a drink or placed
below. They say that if a woman great with child walks
over the root that she aborts, and that tied around her it
hastens the birth. It is taken as a drink with wine against
deadly poisons, especially against the sea hare. Applied,
it is a remedy against the bites of snakes, and mixed with
wine it causes drunkenness. Three teaspoonfuls (taken in 
a drink with passum [raisin wine] or honey diluted in
water) drives away yellow jaundice, but whoever drinks
it must lie down on his bed in a warm house not open to
the wind, and be covered with many cloths so that he
may sweat (more easily). The sweat that comes out is
found to be a bile colour. Juice from cyclaminus is put into
the nostrils with honey to purge the head. It is inserted on 
wool into the perineum to bring down excrement from
the bowels. Rubbed on the navel and the lower part of
the bowels and the hips it softens the bowels, and
produces abortions. The juice rubbed on with honey is
good for bathing the eyes and moisture of the eyes. It is
also mixed with medicines that cause abortion. The juice
rubbed on with vinegar restores a fallen perineum. The
pounded root is juiced and squeezed out, the juice then
boiled to the consistency of honey. The root with vinegar
(either alone or with honey) cleans the skin, stops
pustules from breaking out and cures wounds. Applied,
it softens the spleen (and reduces it). It takes away
sunburn, and [repairs] the loss of hair. A decoction
applied with hot cloths is suitable for dislocations, gout,
little ulcers on the head and chilblains. Boiled in old oil
and the oil smeared on, it brings wounds to a scar. The
root is made hollow, filled with oil, and set over warm
ashes (and sometimes a little Tyrrhenian [Etruscan] wax
is added so that it is gluey). This is an excellent ointment
for those troubled with chilblains. The root is kept in
storage, cut in pieces like squill. It is said that it is
pounded and made into lozenges and taken with
catapotia [pills]. It grows in shady places, especially under
trees. It is also called cissanthemon, cissophylon, chelonion,
ichthyotheron, chuline, zoroastris, or trimphalites; Osthenes
calls it aspho, the Magi, miaspho, the Egyptians, theske, the
Romans, rapum terrae, umbilicus terrae, or orbicularis, and
it is also called arcar.

The other cyclamen (also called cissanthemon or
cissophylon) has leaves similar to cissus but smaller;
thick, knotty stalks rolling around the trees that grow
next to them, similar to the tendrils of vines. The flowers
are white and fragrant, and the fruit is bunches of berries 
similar to cissus, soft, single, sharp to the taste and
viscous. The root is useless. It grows in rough places. One
teaspoon of the fruit (taken in a drink with two cups of
white wine [daily] for forty days) melts the spleen, and
brings down the intestines by urine. It is taken in a drink
for asthma. Taken in a drink it purges away the residue
[placenta] after childbearing.

 Dracontia radix — Dragonwort, Common Dragon, 
Dragon Arum, Snake Plant, Lords and Ladies
Dracontium maius  grows in shady places around
hedges. It has a smooth upright stalk about two feet
in height and the thickness of a staff around, over-
coloured according to the time, so that it resembles a
dragon, and it abounds in purple spots. It has leaves like
lapathum [2-140] folded within one another. It brings
forth a fruit on the top of the stalk in clusters — at first an
ash colour, but when ripe inclining to a saffron and
purple colour. It has a very great root, round, white, with
a thin bark. It is gathered and juiced when thoroughly
ripe, and dried in the shade. The root is dug up during
harvest, washed, cut in small pieces, thrust through with
a thong and dried in the shade. It is warming, taken in a
drink with diluted wine. Boiled or roasted it is good
(taken as a linctus [syrup] with honey) for orthopnoea
[form of asthma], hernia, convulsions, coughs, and
dripping fluids. Taken in a drink with wine it stirs up the
vehement desire to sexual intercourse [ aphrodisiac].
Pounded into small pieces with honey and applied, it
 327
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

takes away the malignancy of ulcers and eating ulcers
(especially with the white vine [bryony]). Suppositories
are formed from it with honey for fistulas, and for use as
an abortifacient. It is good for vitiligines [form of leprosy]
smeared on with honey. It takes away polyps and
diseases of the cornea. The juice is good for eye
medicines, small clouds in the eye, white spots on the
cornea, and mistiness in the eyes. The smell of the root or
herb is destructive of recent conceptions [ abortifacient],
as are thirty grains of the seed (taken in a drink with posca
[hot drinks]). Some pour the juice of this (with oil) into
the ears of those with earache, and apply the leaves as an
astringent on new wounds, as well as boiled in wine to
those with chilblains. They say that a viper shall not bite
those who rub the leaves in their hands or carry the dug
up root about them. It is also called aron, isaron, iaron,
hieracicus, biaron, aron agreste, or cyperis; the Romans call it
colubrina, some, mauriaria, and others call it sigingialios.

SEEDS POISONOUS
Dracontium or dracunculus has large leaves similar to
cissus with white spots and an upright stalk forty
inches high, over-coloured, like the shape of a snake,
spotted with purple spots, and the thickness of a stalk.
The fruit on the top is similar to clusters of grapes, the
colour at first indeed similar to grass but when ripe
similar to saffron, biting to the taste. The root is round
and bulbous, similar to aron [2-197], with a thin bark. It
grows in shady places around hedges and mounds. The
juice of the seed (pressed out and put with oil into the
ear) stops earaches. Put into the nostrils with wool it
destroys polyps. Rubbed on, it stops diseases of the
cornea [eyes]. As much as thirty grains (taken as a drink
with posca [hot drinks]) cause abortion. They say that the
smell of it after the flowers have withered destroys newly 
conceived embryos [ abortifacient]. The root has a
warming quality and helps asthma, hernias, convulsions,

coughs, and dripping fluids. It makes the moisture
sticking in the chest easily expectorated given either
boiled or roasted with honey, or else eaten alone. Dried
and pounded fine it is taken in syrup with honey. It is
diuretic and (taken in a drink of wine) stirs up affections
to sexual intercourse [ aphrodisiac]. Pounded fine with
white bryony and honey it cleans malignant and
spreading ulcers and brings them to a scar. Salves are
made from it for fistulas, and for bringing out the embryo
[abortifacient]. They say that if any one rubs his hands
with the root he remains unbitten by a viper. It cleans
away vitiligines [form of leprosy] rubbed on with vinegar.
The leaves pounded into small pieces are effectively
applied to one newly wounded instead of flax seed. For
chilblains it is boiled in wine and applied. Wrapped in the 
leaves, cheese is kept from putrefying. The juice of the
root is good for small clouds in the eye, white spots on the 
cornea, and dim vision. The root is used for health (eaten
either boiled or raw). Those who live in the Gymnesian
Isles called Baleares mix the boiled root with a lot of
honey and place it in their banquets instead of placentae
[cakes]. The roots must be put in jars by those who dug it
up during the harvest, having first washed them, cut
them in small pieces, made a thread go through them and 
dried them in the shade.

Arum colocasia, Arum esculenta, Colocasia antiquorum,
 Colocasia esculenta, Caladium nymphaefolium 
— Egyptian Arum, Colocasia, Eatable Arum, Taro
 Arum maculatum [Linnaeus] — Sago
Aron sends out leaves similar to those of dracontium,
yet smaller and less spotted; a faint purple stalk
twenty centimetres long in the shape of a pestle, in which 
is fruit inclining to a saffron colour. The root — white like
that of dracontium — is also [a vegetable] eaten boiled,
and is somewhat less sharp. The leaves are preserved in
salt for eating. Dried, they are boiled and eaten by
themselves. The roots, seeds and leaves have the same
strength as dracontium. Particularly the root, applied with
bullock's dung to those troubled with gout, does them
 331
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

good. The root is stored in the same way as the root of
dracunculum. In brief it is edible because it is not
oversharp. It is also called lupha; among the Syrians it is
called alimon, some call it thymon, some, dracontium, and
the Cyprians call it colocassion.
2-198. ARISARON
SUGGESTED: Arum arisarum, Arisarum vulgare — Aris,
 Friar’s Cowl 
Arisarum is a small little herb with a root the size of an
olive tree’s, but it is sharper than  aron [arum]. As a
result (rubbed on) it prevents gangrenous ulceration of
the cheeks. Salves are made from it that are effective for
fistulas, but either put in or applied it destroys the
genitals of any living creature. 
2-199. ASPHODELOS
SUGGESTED:  Asphodelus foemina [Fuchs], Lilium purpureum
[Brunfels], Lilium martagone [Linnaeus], Asphodelus albus,
Asphodelus ramosus — Asphodel, King’s Rod
Asphodelus is a plant (known to most) with leaves
similar to the great leek and a smooth stalk. On the
top is a flower called anthericon. The roots are underneath 
— somewhat long, round, similar to suppositories, sharp
to the taste, and warming in strength. A teaspoonful of
these (taken in a drink of wine) induces the movement of
urine and the menstrual flow. They also cure pains of the
side, coughs, convulsions and hernia. It causes easy
vomiting if as much as a knucklebone is eaten with meat.
As much as three teaspoonfuls given to those bitten by
snakes is effective; and you must apply a poultice made
of the leaves, root and flowers with wine to bites. The
sediment of wine boiled together with the root cures
filthy feeding ulcers, inflammation of the breasts, stones
[kidney, urinary], tubercula [ nodules], and boils or
inflammatory tumours, but for new inflammation [it is to
be applied] with polenta. The juice of the root with old
sweet wine, myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116] and saffron, (boiled
together) is an excellent medicine to rub on the eyes.
Either alone or warmed together with frankincense,

honey, wine and myrrh it is good to put into purulent
ears. The juice (alone) poured into the opposing ear,
lessens toothache. The burnt ashes of the root are rubbed
on to thicken thinned hair. The oil (boiled in the
hollowed roots over a fire) is rubbed on ulcerated
chilblains and burns; and poured into the ear it helps
earache. The root is smeared on to take away vitiligo alba
[type of leprosy] that is first rubbed with a napkin in the
sun. The seed and flowers (taken in a drink of wine) are
an extraordinary remedy against the strikes of
millipedes, centipedes and scorpions. However they
purge the intestines excessively. It bears flowers at the
time of harvest but white asphodelus must be cut down
around the vernal equinox before the seed increases.
They say that the root (taken in a drink) makes men have
no appetite for pursuit of sexual pleasure
[anaphrodisiac]. And Crateuas the herbalist says the
same and that one teaspoonful of the root (taken as a
drink with wine) cures the pains of gout. It is also called
anthericum, and the Romans call it albucium.
2-200. BOLBOS EDODIMOS 
SUGGESTED: Bulbus sylvestris [Fuchs], Ornithogalum luteum
[Bauhin, Linnaeus], Gagea lutea [in Sprague] 
— Yellow Star of Bethlehem
The edible red bulbus that is brought from Africa is well 
known to all; good for the stomach and bowels. That
which is bitter and similar to the squill is better for the
stomach and helps digestion. All are sharp and warming,
provoke sexual intercourse [ aphrodisiac], and are harsh
to the tongue and tonsils. They are very nourishing and
replenish flesh but they breed wind. Rubbed on they are
good for dislocations, bruises, splinters, sore joints,
gangrene, and gout (applied either with honey or by
themselves). They are good for oedema from dropsy, and
the bites of dogs (applied similarly with honey, and
pepper pounded into small pieces). They repress sweats
and alleviate pains in the stomach. Roasted with saltpetre 
[potassium nitrate] they clean away dandruff and
running sores on the head. They clean bruises below the
eyes applied either alone or with the yolk of an egg, and
with honey or vinegar [they also remove] varos [smallpox
 335
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

pustules], as well as freckles. With polenta they are good
for broken places of the ears, and for bruise ointments.
They take away piles [ haemorrhoids] roasted in hot
embers and applied with the burnt heads of fish called
maenae. Burnt and mixed with alcyonium [5-136] and
rubbed on in the sun they take away sunburn and black
scars. Boiled and eaten with vinegar they are good for
hernias. Care must be taken of feeding too much on them
because they hurt the sinews. Boiled with polenta and
applied with swines’ grease it quickly brings oedema and
tubercles [growths] to suppuration and breaks them. 
2-201. BOLBOS EMETIKOS
SUGGESTED: Scilla amoena — Nodding Squill
 Ornithogalum arabicum — Great-flowered Star of Bethlehem 
Bulbus vomitorius has more flexible leaves — similar to
a bridle and far bigger than the edible; and a root
with a black bark similar to the bulbus [above]. The root
eaten alone (as well as a decoction of it taken as a drink)
cures disorders of the bladder and encourages vomiting. 
2-202. SKILLA
SUGGESTED: Scilla maritima [Linnaeus]
Ornithogalum maritima, Urginea scilla, Urginea maritima 
— Medicinal Squill, Sea Onion, Squill 
VERY POISONOUS
Scilla is sharp and burning but it is roasted and made
useful for man’s purposes. It is wrapped in dough or
clay and put into an oven or hidden under hot coals until
the dough that enfolds it is sufficiently baked. When
taken off (if the squill within it is not tender) we shall bake 
it again, placing other dough or clay around it — for that
which is not thus roasted is hurtful if given, especially if it
is (taken inwardly) carried to the bowels. It is likewise
baked in a tightly-corked ceramic jar and put into an
oven, and of that the very middle part is taken, the part
around the outside of it being thrown away. It is then cut
into pieces and boiled, the first water thrown away and
fresh water poured on it, until the water becomes neither
bitter nor sharp. It is also cut into pieces and dried in the

shade and the pieces thrust through with a little linen
thread, so that the parcels may not touch one another.
These pieces we use to manufacture oil, wine, and
vinegar of squills. 
For cracks in the feet the inner part of the raw squill is
applied (either boiled in oil or else dissolved with rosin).
Boiled with vinegar it is a plaster for those bitten by
vipers. Mixing eight parts of roasted salt (pounded into
small pieces) to one part of roasted squill we give one
spoonful or two of it to those fasting for softening the
bowels. Put into liquid medicines and aromatic
medicines it is good for those in whom we wish to induce
movement of urine, for dropsy, a stomach in which the
meat swims above, jaundice, griping, those troubled with 
a cough for a long time, the asthmatic, and those who spit 
up (blood). Thirty grains (taken as a syrup with honey) is
sufficient. It is boiled together with honey and eaten for
the same purposes, very much facilitating mixtures. It
also draws out the slimy stuff that sticks in the bowels.
Boiled and taken in the same way it does the same, and
must be avoided by those who have an inward
ulceration. Roasted squill (rubbed on) is good for hanging 
warts and chilblains. The seed (pounded into small pieces 
and eaten with a dried fig or honey) softens the bowels. It
is also an antidote against poison hanged up whole
before doors. 
2-203. PANICRATION
SUGGESTED: Pancratium maritimum, Scilla pancratium
— Sea Pancratium Lily, Sea Daffodil 
Pancratium (also called the little squill) has a pale red or 
pale purple root similar to the great bulbus, and a
bitter burning taste. The leaves are similar to lilies but
longer. It has a similar strength and preparation as the
squill and the same dose [is to be taken of it]. It is good for
the same disorders but has a milder nature than squill. As
a result the root (juiced and mixed with flour of ervum
[2-129, 2-131] and formed into tablets) is effective given
with honey water for the spleen, and dropsy.

2-204. KAPPARIS
SUGGESTED: Capparis spinosa — Common Caper Bush, Caper
Capparis is a prickly shrub spread in a round
circumference on the ground. There are prickles on
the bush, crooked like a hook. The leaves are round
(similar to those of the malicottoon [quince] tree), and the
fruit similar to olives. On opening it first sends forth a
white flower, which, falling off, there is found something
in the shape of of a long suppository. When opened this
has little red grains similar to those of a pomegranate. The 
many roots are woody and great. It grows only in rough
barren places, islands, and in courtyards belonging to
houses. Both the stalk and fruit are preserved in salt to
eat. It disturbs the belly, is worthless for the stomach, and
causes thirst. Eaten boiled it is better for the stomach than
raw. Two teaspoonfuls of the fruit reduces the spleen
(taken in a drink with wine daily for forty days); it also
expels urine and bloody excrement. The same (taken in a
drink) helps sciatica and palsy, and is good for hernia and 
convulsions. Boiled in vinegar and used as a mouthwash
it dries out the menstrual flow, draws away mucus in the
head, and it lessens toothache.  The dry rind of the root is
good for the things spoken of before, and also cleans
away every old, filthy, hard ulcer. It is laid (with barley
meal) on those troubled with spleen, and the root is bitten 
to help a pained tooth. Pounded into small pieces with
vinegar it takes away white vitiligines [form of leprosy].
The leaves and root pounded together dissolve hard
lumps, scrofulous tumours [ glandular swelling], and
goitres. The juice poured in the ears kills worms in there.
The African caper (especially that which grows near the
people called Marmaridae) causes excessive gaseousness.
That in Apulia encourages vomiting, but that from the
Red Sea and Arabia is extremely sharp, raising pustules in 
the mouth and eating up the gums to the bare bone,
therefore it is useless for eating. It is also called cynosbatos
(as we would say, dog’s bush), capria, the apple of a crow,
ophioscorodon, or ophiostapllylen (i.e. snake’s grape),
thallian, petraea, holophyton, ioniten, or oligocloron, aconitum, 
hippomanes, or trichomanes. The Magi call it potera, some,

2-205. LEPIDION 
SUGGESTED: Lepidium latifolium [Bauhin, Linnaeus] 
— Dittander, Pepperwort, Green Mustard 
 Lepidium campestre, Thlaspi campestre — Pepperwort 
Lepidium (also called gingidium) is a well-known little
herb that is preserved in brine with milk. The leaves
are sharp and ulcerating. Pounded into small pieces with
root of elecampane and applied for a quarter of an hour,
it is a most effective plaster for sciatica. It is also good in
the same way for the spleen and it takes away leprosy.
The root is thought to take away toothache, hung around
the neck.

 Ranunculus asiaticus — Turban
 Ranunculus arvensis — Corn Crowfoot, Corn Buttercup 
Apium sylvestre, Agreste apium, Sclerata [Fuchs], 
Ranunculus palustris [Bauhin], Ranunculus aquaticus,
 Ranunculus scleratus, Ranunculus aquatilius 
— Water Crowfoot, Water Anemone  
ALL POISONOUS
There are many kinds of batrachium (also called apium
agreste), but their strength is the same — sharp and
very ulcerating. One of them has leaves similar to those of 
coriander, yet broader and somewhat white and fat. The
flower is a yellowish colour and sometimes purple. The
stalk is not thick, in height about a foot. It has a bitter little
root, with little fibrous strings growing out (like that of
hellebore). It grows near rivers or running water. The
other kind is more downy and longer-stalked, with more
in-cuttings on the leaves, and is extremely sharp. It grows 
 343
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

abundantly in Sardinia where they call it apium agreste.
There is a third very small kind with a hard taste and a
flower like gold, and a fourth (similar to this) with a
flower the colour of milk. The leaves and the tender stalks 
(rubbed on) are ulcerating and scab forming, with pain.
As a result, applied for only a little time, they take away
scabby nails and parasitic skin diseases; and they remove
marks, as well as taking away abscesses, hanging warts,
and alopecia [baldness]. A lukewarm boiled decoction of it
is a suitable warm pack for those troubled with chilblains. 
The dried root pounded into small pieces and applied to
the nostrils causes sneezing. Applied to teeth it eases
toothache but breaks the teeth.
2-207. ANEMONE
SUGGESTED: Anemone sylvestris [Fuchs], Anemone pulsillata
[Linnaeus], Pulsatilla vulgaris — Pasque Flower [Mabberley]
 Anemone pavonina, Anemone hortensis — Garden Anemone
POISONOUS
Anemone has two types — one wild, the other
cultivated. Of the cultivated some bear flowers in a
Phoenician [red] colour, others of a pale, milky or purple
colour. The leaves are similar to coriander but less
ragged, next to the ground. The little stalks are downy,
thin, on which are flowers like poppies with the heads in
the middle black or azure [blue]. The root is the size of
that of the olive or bigger. The wild is altogether bigger
than the cultivated, broader and harder in the leaves, and 
it has a longer head. The flower is a Phoenician [red]
colour; there are many small little roots; and there is one
kind that has black leaves and is sharper. They are both
sharp; as a result the juice of the root poured into the
nostrils helps in purging the head. The chewed root
extracts mucus. Boiled in passum [raisin wine] and
applied it cures inflammation of the eyes, and mends
scars in the eyes and moisture in the eyes; and it cleans
the filthiness of ulcers. The leaves and stalks boiled
together with barley water (and eaten) draw out milk
[breastfeeding]. In a pessary it encourages the menstrual
flow. Rubbed on it takes away leprosy.

Some, not being able to distinguish between that
which is called argemone and the papaver rhoeas [4-64] (of
which we will speak when we come to discussion of
poppies) from the wild anemone, because of the
similarity of the colour of the flowers which are a
Phoenician colour [red], are deceived calling argemone
‘eupatorium’ [4-41]. Yet the Phoenician [red] colour of the
argemone is somewhat less deep, as well as that of the
rhoeas, and both it and argemone flower later. The argemone
yields juice of a saffron colour that is extremely sharp to
the taste, but the rhoeas has a whiter, sharp juice. Both of
them have little heads between (similar to the wild
poppy), but those of argemone are somewhat broader at
the top, and those of rhoeas somewhat narrower.
Anemones neither give out juice nor have they a head or
cup, but (as it were) a top like asparagus, and they grow
them for the most part in fields.
It is also called wild anemone, black anemone, purple
anemone, anemion, meconium, tragoceros, gesparine, or
barbyle. Osthenes calls it berylius, Ornios calls it ceranios,
Pythagoras calls it atractylis, the Magi, cnicus agrestis, the
Romans, orci tunica, and the Africans, chuffis. 
2-208. ARGEMONE
SUGGESTED: Papaver argemone, Papaver hybridum 
— Pale Poppy, Wind Rose, Rough Poppy, Cock’s Head,
 Sand Poppy 
Argemone is very like the wild poppy. It has a divided
leaf similar to anemone, a flower on the stalk a
Phoenician [red] colour, with a head similar to papaver
rhoeas [4-64] but somewhat longer and broad towards the
upper parts, and a round root. It yields sharp juice of a
saffron colour. The leaves applied as a poultice take away
argemae [small white ulcers on the cornea] and small
clouds in the eye, and lessen inflammation. Crateuas the
herbalist says (to the same intent) that this herb
argemone pounded together with swines' grease
dissolves scrofulous tumours [ glandular swelling,
goitres]. It is good for white leprosy dried, pounded with
saltpetre [potassium nitrate] and sulphur that has not felt
fire, and sifted. It cures those who use it (rubbed on dry
first) in a bath. It is also effective against scab [ itchy
 347
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

parasitical skin diseases]. It is also called oenone, anthemis
arvensis, or homonoia, (as we should say) concord, or flos
campestris; the Romans call it liburnia, or concordialis, and it 
is also called pergalia; the Gauls call it corna.
2-208a. ARGEMONE
SUGGESTED: Papaver armenaicum, Papaver caucasicum,
 Papaver floribundum, Papaver orientale  — Poppy species
The other argemone is like wild poppy in the leaves.
Pounded into small pieces (while still green) and
applied, it is able to cure cuts and lessen inflammation of
the eyes. It is good (taken in a drink with water) for
dysentery. It seals wounds and is good applied to
inflammation. Similarly applied it cures convulsions and
twitching. It is good (taken in a drink of wine) for those
bitten by poisonous beasts. It is also called artemone,
arselam, or sarcocolla; the Romans call it artemonia.
2-209. ANAGALLIS, KORKOROS
SUGGESTED: Anagallis mas [Fuchs], Anagallis arvensis
[Linnaeus], Anagallis phoenecea, Anagallis repens,
 Lysimachia adoensis — Scarlet Pimpernel,
Poor Man’s Weather Glass 
 Anagallis foemina [Fuchs, Linnaeus], Anagallis coerulea 
— Blue Pimpernel 
POISONOUS — CAUSES ANAEMIA AND DERMATITIS
[other usage] Korkoros, Corchoris olitorius — Corchorus 
There are two kinds of anagallis, differing in the flower, 
for that which has an azure [blue] flower is called the
female, but that of a Phoenician [red] colour is called the
male. They are little shrubs spreading on the ground,
with small leaves on their four-cornered little stalks,
somewhat round, similar to those of helxine [4-39, 4-86],
with round fruit. They are both lessening in strength,
drive away inflammation, extract [draw out] splinters or
thorns that were run into the body, and repress
gangrenous ulcers. The juice gargled purges the head of
mucus, and poured into the nostrils it stops toothache. It
is put in the opposing nostril to the sore tooth. With Attic

[Athenian] honey it mends argemae [small white ulcers on 
the cornea] and helps moisture of the eyes. It is good
(taken as a drink with wine) for those bitten by vipers, as
well as for kidney and liver ailments, and for dropsy, but
some say that if the anagallis which has the azure [blue]
flower is applied it stops prolapse of the perineum, and
that which has the Phoenician [red] flower encourages it. 
Some call it punicea, others, aeritis, aegitis, or sauritis,
the Magi call it oculi sanguis , others, chelidonion, the
Romans, macia, the Etruscans, masitipos, the Gauls, sapana, 
the Dacians, cerceraphron. The common anagallis some call 
corchoros, halicacabus, or zeliauros, the Magi, nycteritis, the
Egyptians call it  micij, the Romans, meciato, and the
Africans, asirrhizi. 
2-210. KISSOS
SUGGESTED: Hedera nigra, Hedera helix [Fuchs, Linnaeus] 
 — Common Ivy
ALSO: Hedera helix poetica, Hedera helix vegeta 
[other usage] Cissus quadrangularis, Vitis quadrangularis
 — Edible Stemmed Vine 
Cissus digitata — Wild Grape, Sorrel Vine 
Cissus has many differences (according to the type)
but there are three most particular kinds, for some is
white, some black and another helix [spiralled]. The
white therefore bears a white fruit, the black a black one
or sometimes a saffron colour (which the vulgar sort also
call dionysium), but the helix [spiralled] is without fruit
and has white branches and thin leaves, is full of corners
and red. All cissus is sharp and astringent and touches the 
sinewy parts. The flowers (as much as one can take up of
them with three fingers) taken in a drink of wine are
good for dysentery, but it must be taken in a drink twice a 
day. The same amount (pounded into small pieces with
waxy ointments) are good for burns. The tender leaves
boiled with vinegar (or the raw ones pounded together
with bread) heal the spleen. The juice from the leaves and 
berries with irinum [1-66], honey, or saltpetre [potassium
nitrate] is poured into the nostrils and is good for old
sores on the head. The head is moistened with this juice
(with vinegar and rosaceum) [1-53], and with oil it cures
sore, purulent ears. The juice and clusters [of fruit] (taken
as a drink) cause sterility, and taken in too great an
 351
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

amount trouble the mind. Five berries from a cluster of
berries (pounded fine, warmed with rosaceum in a
pomegranate skin) dropped into the opposite ear during
toothache lessen the pain. The clusters of berries dye the
hair black. 
The leaves (boiled as previously mentioned) are laid
as a poultice on any sort of ulcer; and applied as poultices
cure sunburn and very bad burns. The clusters of berries
(pounded fine and given as a pessary) induce the
menstrual flow. A teaspoonful taken as a drink after
womens’ cleansing hinders conception. The stalks of the
leaves moistened with honey and put into the vulva
expel the menstrual flow and are an abortifacient. The
juice (dropped in) purges away the stinking smell in the
nostrils and their rotten ulcers. The oozing of cissus
removes hair [depilatory], and rubbed on it kills lice. The
juice from the roots (taken as a drink with vinegar) helps
those bitten by harvest spiders. It is also called cittaros,
cissaros, chrysocarpos, poetica, corymbias, or cussion, (as we
would say,  hederula), dionysia, (a sort of bacchicei),
ithutherion, persis, cemos, or asplenos; the Romans call it
silvae mater, some, hedera, and the Gauls, subites. 
2-211. CHELIDONION
SUGGESTED: Chelidonium majus [Fuchs, Bauhin, Linnaeus] 
— Swallow Wort, Greater Celandine
Chelidonia the greater sends out a slender stalk the
height of a foot or more with branches full of leaves.
The leaves are similar to those of ranunculus, yet those of
chelidonia are more tender, somewhat a sky blue colour,
and by every leaf there is a flower like leucoion [3-138].
The juice is a saffron colour — sharp, biting, a little bitter,
and with a strong smell. The root is single at the upper
end but divided lower down, and a saffron colour. The
fruit is like horned poppy — slender, long like a cone —
in which are little seeds, bigger however than those of
poppy. The juice of this (mixed with honey and boiled in
a brass jar over coals) is good for sharpening the sight
[eyes]. The leaves, root and fruit are juiced when they
emerge in summer. This juice is dried in the shade and
made into little balls. The root cures jaundice, taken in a
drink with  anisum  [3-65] and white wine; and also

applied with wine for herpes [ viral skin infection]. It
lessens toothache if chewed. It seems to be called
chelidonia because it springs out of the ground together
with the swallows’ appearance and withers with them
departing. Some have related that if any of the swallows’
young ones is blind, the female parents bring this herb to
heal it. It is also called paeonia, crataea, aoubios, glaucios,
pandionis radix, philomedion, or othonion; the Romans call it
fabium, the Gauls, thona, the Egyptians, mothoth, and the
Dacians, crustane.

SUGGESTED: Chelidonium minus, Scrofularia [Fuchs]
Malacocissus minor [Brunfels], Chelidonia rotundifolia minor
[Bauhin], Ranunculus ficaria [Linnaeus] — Celadine
Chelidonia minor  (which some have called sylvestre
triticum) is a little herb full of little feet, without a
stalk (compact), with leaves similar to cissus [2-210], yet
much rounder, smaller, tender and somewhat fat. It has
many small roots from a single place, growing close
together like wheat grains, but there are three or four
which grow out long. It grows around waters and
marshy places. It is sharp like anemone, ulcerating to the
outside of the skin. It takes away parasitic skin diseases
and scabbed nails. The juiced roots are put into the
nostrils with honey for purging the head. Similarly a
decoction of it gargled with honey powerfully purges the
head, and purges all things out of the chest. 
2-213. OTHONNA
SUGGESTED: Othonna — African Ragwort 
 Othonna cheirifolia — Barbary Ragwort 
The plant of the ancients can have had little affinity with that of the moderns
[Loudon].
Some say othonna is the juice of chelidonia major, some of 
glaucium, some say that it is the juice of the flowers of
horned poppy, some that it is a mixture of the juices of
anagallis coerulea  [2-209], hyoscyamus [4-69] and poppy,
and some say that it is the juice of a certain primitive herb
called othonna, and that it grows in the part of Arabia that
 355
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

lies towards Egypt. It has only a few leaves (like eruca
[2-170]) full of holes as though they were wormeaten, ill-
favoured or mouldy. It bears a broad-petalled saffron-
coloured flower, as a result some think it to be a kind of
anemone. It is juiced and put into eye medicines for
when there is need of cleansing the eyes; it has a biting
nature and removes all things that darken the pupils
whatsoever. Some say that there is a certain kind of fluid
that flows from the herb, which, washing and removing
the stones from it, they make into lozenges for the same
use. Some say that othonna is an Egyptian stone found in
Thebais — the colour of brass, small in size, biting to the
taste, with a certain kind of burning and astringency.

Muris auriculae (also called myosotis) sends out many
hollow stalks of a somewhat reddish colour

somewhat long and narrow with the backbone of them
standing out, a blackish colour, growing up by distances,
two and two, ending in a sharp point. Thinner little stalks 
grow out of the wings, on which are little flowers of a sky- 
blue colour, small like those of anagallis [2-209]. The root is 
the thickness of a finger with many hairy strings. The root 
of this (applied) heals ulcers in the inner angle of the eye.
Finally, the herb is similar to scolopendrium [3-121] yet
smoother and smaller. Some also call it  alsine, myoton,
anthyllion, myortochon, or myrtosplenon; the Romans call it
muris auricula, and the Africans, labatholabat.

SUGGESTED: Isatis sativa [Fuchs], Isatis tinctoria var sativa
[Linnaeus], Pastel, Glastum — Woad, Ash of Jerusalem,
 Dyer’s Weed
 cultivated,  POISONOUS — fermented leaves produce indigo blue dye
Isatis sativa (which the dyers use) has a leaf like plantain
but fatter and darker, and a stalk over two feet high.
The leaves (applied) are able to dissolve any oedema or
tumour, heal bloody wounds, stop bleeding, and cure
spreading ulcers, herpes [viral skin infection] and rotten
ulcers. It is also called augion, or egne, the Magi call it
arusium, and the Romans, ruta. 
2-216. ISATIS AGRIA
SUGGESTED: Isatis sylvestris [Fuchs], Isatis tinctoria var vulgaris
[Linnaeus], Isatis campestris — Field Woad 
Isatis sylvestris is similar to that mentioned above but it
has bigger leaves nearly the size of those of lettuce, and 
slender somewhat reddish stalks with many slits. On the
top hang many little pods similar to tongues in which is
the seed, and a thin flower of a yellowish colour. It is
similar in effectiveness to that spoken of before, and is
also good for the splenetic, taken as a drink and also
applied. It is also called egne parva; the Romans call it ruta
minor.
(It is to be understood that these descriptions of isatis
contain that which is erroneous, for the cultivated bears
both a yellowish flower and more slender and much
divided branches and little pods on the top, like tongues
in which are the seeds, but there is contained in these a
black seed similar to melanthium [3-93], and it bears a stalk
over two feet high and not only over one foot high. But
the wild sort bears blacker leaves than this, a lower,
thicker stalk, a flower of a purple or azure [blue] colour
and the fruit like a cross, sharp, in which are the seed,
separated or distinguished in a way by five little leaves
apiece and those equal. — Goodyer)

Acetabulum alterum album, Acetabulum alterum purpureum
[Brunfels], Sedum telephium [Linnaeus], Sedum vulgare,
 Sedum purpureum, Telefio [Italian] — Orpine, Livelong,
Midsummer Men 
Telephium is similar to andrachne [2-150] both in the
leaves and stalk, with two wings sticking from every
knot of the leaves; six or seven small branches from the
root, full of azure-coloured [blue] leaves — thick, tough
and fleshy; the flowers a yellowish or whitish colour. It
grows in the springtime in vineyards and clay or shale
places. The leaves applied for six hours cure white
leprosy, but after this you must use barley meal. Rubbed
on with vinegar in the sun they take away vitiligines
[type of leprosy], but after they have dried they must be
wiped off. Some call it sempervivum sylvestre, and some
call it portulaca sylvestris, the Romans call it illecebra, the
Egyptians, anoth, and the Africans, atirtopuris.

BOOK THREE: ROOTS
In the previous books, most loving Areius, we have
talked of spices, ointments, oils, trees and their fruits,
of lacrymae [resins], as well as living creatures, grains,
vegetables, and herbs possessing sharpness; but in this
the third book we will set out an account of roots, juices,
herbs, and seeds — suitable both for common use and for
medications.
3-1. AGARICON 
SUGGESTED: Fomes officinalis, Polyphorus officinalis, 
Boletus purgans, Polyphorus igniarius, Boletus laricis, 
Ungulina officinalis — Agaric
[other usage] Agaricus aurantiacus — Orange Mushroom 
 Agaricus campestris — Common Mushroom 
Agaricum is said to be a root similar to silphium [3-94],
not thick on the outside like silphium, but all thin.
Some of it is male and some female, of which the female
excels, having straight veins within, but the male is round 
and grows the same on all sides. In taste both are the
same, tasting sweet indeed at first; after dissolving it
grows bitter. It grows in Agaria in the Sarmatian
(country). Some say it is the root of a tree, some that it
grows in the stocks of trees that are rotten, like
mushrooms. It also grows in Galatia in Asia, and in Cilicia
on the cedars but this is brittle and weak. As for the
properties of it: it is astringent and warming, good for
griping, indigestion, hernias, and falls from on high.
Twenty grains is given with honeyed wine to those not
feverish, but it is given in honey and water to the
feverish. For liver ailments, asthma, jaundice, dysentery,
nephritis, dysuria, womb constriction, and sickly looks a
teaspoonful is given. To those with tuberculosis of the
lungs it is given with passum [raisin wine]; and to the
splenetic with vinegar and honey. For gastritis it is given
as it is, chewed and swallowed down without moisture
poured on it. In a similar way it is given for acidic
vomiting. Thirty grains (taken with water) stops the
 363
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

throwing-up of blood. An equal amount (taken with
vinegar and honey) is good for sore hips, sore joints, and
epilepsy. It encourages the menstrual flow, and the same
weight is effectively given to women with a suffocated
womb. It dissolves shivering, given before a fever fit. A
teaspoonful or two (taken as a drink with honey and
water) purges the bowels. It is an antidote for poison
taken with one teaspoonful of diluted wine; and thirty
grains (taken as a drink with wine) helps the strikes and
bites of snakes. Finally, it is good for all internal disorders, 
given according to strength and age — to some with
water, to others with wine, and to others with vinegar
and honey, or honey and water. 
3-2. RA 
SUGGESTED: Rabarabo [Italian], Rheum officinale 
— Wild Rhubarb
Rheum rhaponticum — Rhapontic, Pie Rhubarb,
 Garden Rhubarb 
the leaves are POISONOUS
Rha grows in places beyond the Bosporus, from where 
it is brought. The root is outwardly black, similar to
centaury the larger, yet smaller and redder within. It is
without smell, loose, somewhat light, but the best is not
wormeaten, and is slimy to the taste with a weak
astringency. Chewed, it is pale and somewhat similar to
saffron in colour. 
It is good (taken in a drink) for gaseousness, weakness 
of the stomach, all types of suffering, convulsions, spleen, 
liver ailments, inflammation in the kidneys, griping and
disorders of the bladder and chest, matters related to
hypochondria [ indigestion with nervous disorder],
afflictions around the womb, sciatica, spitting up blood,
asthma, rickets, dysentery, abdominal cavity afflictions,
flows of fevers, and bites from poisonous beasts. You
must give it as you do agaric [above] for every disorder — 
allowing the same amounts with liquids, using it with
honeyed wine to those not feverish, but to the feverish
give it with honey and water; for tuberculosis with
passum [raisin wine]; to the splenetic with vinegar and
honey; for gastritis chewed as it is and swallowed down
(no moisture taken with it). It takes away bruises and

lichen [papular skin disease] rubbed on with vinegar, and
it dissipates obstinate inflammations applied with water.
The chief strength of it is astringency with some heating.
It is also called ria, the Romans call it rha ponticum, and it is 
also called reon.
3-3. GENTIANE
SUGGESTED: Gentiana [Fuchs], Gentiana lutea [Linnaeus],
Asterias lutea, Sweertia lutea — Yellow Gentian
 most bitter plant material known
Gentiana seems indeed first to have been found by
Gentius the king of the Illyrians from whom it took
its surname. The leaves are similar to carya [1-178] or
plantain at the root, somewhat reddish, but those on the
middle stalk and especially those around the top are a
little jagged. The stalk is empty, smooth, the thickness of
a finger, two feet high, divided by joints, surrounded
with leaves at bigger distances; and with broad fruit in
cups, light, chaffed, like sphondylium [3-90]. The long root
is similar to aristolochia [3-4, 3-5, 3-6] — longer, thick and
bitter. It grows on the highest peaks of mountains and in
shady watery places. Two teaspoonfuls of the root are
warming and astringent, and (taken as a drink with
pepper, rice and wine) it helps those bitten by venomous
creatures. A teaspoonful of extracted juice is good for
disorders of the sides, falls from heights, hernia, and
convulsions. It also helps liver ailments and gastritis
taken as a drink with water. The root — especially the
juice — applied as a suppository, is an abortifacient. It is a
wound herb applied like lycium [1-132], a medicine for
deep ulcers, and an ointment for inflamed eyes. The juice
is mixed into the sharper sort of eye salves or
suppositories in place of meconium [4-65]. The root cleans
vitiligines [form of leprosy]. It is juiced by being bruised
and steeped in water for five days, then afterwards boiled 
in the water until the roots appear on top. When the
water is cold it is strained through a linen cloth, boiled
until it becomes like honey in consistency, and stored in a
ceramic jar. It is also called centaurea radix, aloe gallica,
narce, or chironium, the Trojans call it aloitis, the Romans,
gentiana, others, cicendia, or cyminalis.

3-4. ARISTOLOCHIA STROGGOLE
SUGGESTED: Pistolochia [Fuchs], Fumaria bulbosa [Bauhin,
Linnaeus], Corydalis cava [in Sprague] — Fumitory
Aristolochia is called this because it is thought to help
women in childbirth exceedingly well. The round
type is called female; it has leaves similar to cissus —
sweet smelling, with sharpness, somewhat round,
tender, with many shoots on one root. The branches are
very long, the white flowers are similar to little hats, and
the red (part) in them has a bad scent. 
3-5. ARISTOLOCHIA MAKRA
SUGGESTED: Aristolochia pistolochia — Birthwort 
POISONOUS
The long aristolochia is called male and dactylitis, with
leaves somewhat longer than the round aristolochia,
slender branches of about twenty centimetres length,
and purple flowers with a bad scent. These, withering,
become similar to a pear. The root of the round aristolochia 
is like a turnip, but the root of the long kind is the
thickness of a finger, being twenty centimetres long or
more. Both of them are mostly of wood colour, bitter to
taste, and poisonous. It is also called  melocarpum, or
teuxinon, and the Romans call it herba aristolochia.
3-6. ARISTOLOCHIA KLEMATITIS
SUGGESTED: Aristolochia rotunda [Fuchs],  Aristolochia longa
[Fuchs, Brunfels], Aristolochia clematitis [Linnaeus, Bauhin] 
— Round Aristoloch, Apple of Earth, Common Birthwort 
 POISONOUS
There is also a third long type which is called clematitis, 
with slender branches full of somewhat long leaves
similar to the smaller sempervivum [4-89, 4-90, 4-91]. The
flowers are similar to rue [3-52, 3-53, 4-98], bright yellow,
in a terminal flattened inflorescence. The roots are longer, 
slender, with a thick bark and an aromatic smell. The
ointment makers use them effectively for thickening

ointments. One teaspoonful of the round one (taken in a
drink with wine, and also applied) is indeed good for
poisons, but the long one is given for poisons of snakes
and deadly poisons. Taken in a drink with pepper and
myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116] it puts out all remaining bodily
wastes and the menstrual flow, and is an abortifacient.
Applied in a pessary it does the same, and the round is
effective for the things we have mentioned. Moreover,
taken as a drink with water, it helps asthma, rickets,
chills, the spleen, hernias, convulsions, and pains of the
side. Applied, it extracts splinters and prickles, and takes
off scales on bones. With iris and honey it emarginates
[removes the edge of] rotten ulcers, and cleans foul ulcers 
and fills up their hollows. It also cleans gums and teeth. It
is thought that all clematitis is good for these things. Yet
this has less strength than those previously mentioned. It
grows in mountainous or warm, level places or else in
rough, rocky places. It is good for a serious fever, only let
the one with the fever inhale the smoke over coals and
the fever will stop. Applied, it heals wounds. With the
seed of dracunculus [2-196b] and honey it helps
malignancies in the nostrils. Boiled with oil or swine
grease and rubbed on it cures chills. (Crateuas the
Herbalist and Gallus have said the same and that it is
good for the gouty). It is called arariza, melecaprum, ephesia, 
lestitis, pyxionyx, dardanus, or iontitis by some. The Gauls
call it theximon, the Egyptians, sophoeth, the Sicilians,
chamaemelum, the Italians, terrae malum, and the Dacians
call it  absinthium rusticum.
3-7. GLUKORIZA
SUGGESTED: Glycyrrhiza, Liquortia [Fuchs],
Glycyrrhiza glabra [Linnaeus], Glycyrrhiza laevis,
 Liquortia officinalis —  Liquorice Plant
Glycyrrhiza grows abundantly in Cappadocia and
Pontus. It is a little shrub, the branches two feet
high, around which the leaves grow thickly like lentiscum
[1-90], thick and clammy to the touch. The flower is
similar to hyacinth; the fruit, the size of the berries of the
plane tree but sharper, with pods like lentil, red and
small. The roots are long, the colour of wood, similar to
those of gentian, somewhat bitter and sweetish. They are
 371
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

juiced like lycium [1-132]. This juice is good for sharpness
of the arteries but it must be put under the tongue to let it
melt. It is good similarly for burning of the stomach,
disorders in the chest and liver, parasitic skin diseases,
and bladder or kidney disorders. Taken with a drink of
passum [raisin wine] and melted in the mouth it quenches 
thirst. Rubbed on, it heals wounds; and chewed, it is good 
for the stomach. A decoction of the new roots is good for
the same things. The dry root pounded into small pieces
is fit for sprinkling on pterygium [membrane on eye]. It is
also called pontica, glyceraton, symphyton, leontica,
glycyphyton, scythion, adipson, sylithra, libthestaso,
homoenomoea, or peenthaomoeos, and the Latins call it dulcis
radix.
3-8. KENTAURION MAKRON
SUGGESTED: Cyanus, Flos frumentorum [Fuchs],
Cyanus sylvestris [Brunfels], Cyanus segetum [Bauhin],
 Centaurea cyanus [Linnaeus] — Bachelor’s Button
Centaury the great has leaves similar to the carya
[1-178], somewhat long, green in colour (like those
of brassica), the circumference of them cut-in like a saw. It
has a of stalk two or three feet high like lapathum [2-140]
with many shoots from the root. On top are heads like
poppy somewhat large in circumference. The flowers are
azure [blue], and the seed similar to cnicus [4-119, 4-190]
(laid as it were) in downy flowers. The root is thick,
sound, heavy, about two feet long, full of juice, sharp,
with a certain astringency and sweetness, inclining to
red. It loves a rich soil open to the sun, woods and
hillocks. It is abundant in Lycia, Peloponesse, Helis,
Arcadia, Messenia, Pholoe, Lycia, and around Smyrna.
The root is good with wine for hernia, convulsions,
pleurisy, difficulty with breathing, old coughs,
bloodspitters and those without fevers. For the feverish,
two teaspoonfuls of the root is given, pounded into small
pieces with water. Similarly it is given for griping and
sores of the vulva. It expels the menstrual flow and is an
abortifacient, shaved into the form of a suppository and
applied to the vulva. The juice does the same things.
Pounded whilst moist, it is good for wounds. When dry it
is first steeped and then pounded. It draws together,

heals, and joins together flesh that is pale and flaccid, if
you pound it and boil it. In Lycia they juice it and use it
like lycium [1-132]. It is called panacea [heal-all] because it
soothes all sores from inflammation and strong blows.
Used in suppositories it soothes slow and painful
urination, and helps those with stones [kidney, urinary].
It is gathered when the sun is about to rise, in a clear
season, when everything is at its peak. 
It is also called narce, limnesion, marone, pelethronion,
chironias or limnestis, the Magi call it blood of Hercules;
the Romans call it ferum, uvifera, or fel terrae.
3-9. KENTAURION MIKRON
SUGGESTED: Centaurium minus [Fuchs, Bauhin],
Centaurea verutum Erythraea centaurium,
 Chironia centaurium, Gentiana centaurium [Linnaeus],
Centaurium erythraea — Lesser Centaury, Common Centaury, 
Feverwort, Centaury, Earthgall, Dwarf Centaury
The little centaury is a herb similar to hypericum [3-171]
or origanum, with a stalk over twenty centimetres
high that has corners. The flowers are similar to those of
lychnis [3-114, 3-115], a faint Phoenician [reddish] purple.
The leaves are small, very long, like rue [3-52, 3-53, 4-98].
The seed is similar to wheat, the root small, miserable and 
smooth. Pounded while still green and applied it seals
wounds, and purges old ulcers and brings them to a scar.
Boiled and swallowed down, it expels bile and thick
fluids through the bowels. A decoction of it is a fit
suppository for sciatica, drawing out blood and easing
pain. The juice is good for eye medicines with honey,
cleaning away things that darken the pupils. In a pessary
it extracts the menstrual flow and is an abortifacient.
Taken as a drink it is equally good for disorders of the
strength. The herb is juiced; first it is gathered when full
of seed and steeped in water for five days, afterwards it is
boiled until it floats above the water. Afterwards the
cooled herb is pressed and strained through a linen cloth,
and boiled again to the consistency of honey. Some beat it 
(green and full of seed) then press out the juice and throw 
it into an unglazed ceramic jar. They stir it about in the
sun, moving it continuously with a stick, and repeatedly
scraping away pieces that hang out. They mix it with
 375
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK
Centaureum minus
from FUCHS — 1545

moist juice and cover it carefully at night, for dew
prevents the thickening of moist juices. Centaury is good
for inflammation and bruises from strikes, helps women
troubled with motherhood [ pregnancy], and eases the
pain of slow, painful urination and [ urinary] stones.
Gather the herb in the spring at sunrise.
Many of the dry roots or herbs that are juiced are
prepared by boiling (like gentian). Juices pressed out of
moist barks, roots, or herbs are stirred around in the sun
(as previously mentioned) — including thapsia [4-157],
mandragora [mandrake], unripe grapes, and similar
things. Lycium [1-132], wormwood [3-26], hypocistis
[1-127] and herbs similar to these are boiled and stirred
around as previously mentioned. 
Centaury is also called limnesion, helleborites, or
amaranton, the Magi call it the blood of Hercules, the
Romans, febrifuga, some, herba multiradix , the Dacians,
tulbela; and it is also called limnaion because it loves moist
places.

Carlina caulescens [Bauhin], Carlina acaulis [Linnaeus]
— Stemless Carline Thistle
[other usage]  Carlina gummifera, Atractylis gummifera 
— White Chamoeleon 
White chamaeleon is called ixia because in some places 
viscous matter is found at the roots of it which
women use instead of mastic [1-89, 1-90]. It has leaves
similar to silybum [4-159] or carduus nutans [musk thistle]
but rougher, sharper, and stronger than the black
chamaeleon [below]. It does not have a stalk but out of the
middle puts out a prickle similar to that of the sea urchin
or cinara. The flowers are a purple colour, like hairs, flying 
away in down, with seed similar to cnicus [4-119, 4-190].
The root is thick in fertile hills but in the mountains it is
more slender, white at the bottom, somewhat aromatic,
with a strong sweet taste. An acetabulum [vinegar cruet] of 
this (taken in a drink) expels broadworms. It is taken in
hard wine with a decoction of origanum. For dropsy a
teaspoonful is given with wine to ease them. A decoction
is taken in a drink for frequent painful urination. Taken
as a drink with wine it is an antidote to poison. Kneaded
with polenta then diluted with water and oil it kills dogs,
swine, and mice. It is also called chrysisceptrum, or ixia; the 
Romans call it carduus nutans varius, the Egyptians, epher,
and some, epthosephim.

Carduus sphaerocephalus [Bauhin], Echinops sphaerocephalus
[Linnaeus] — Globe Thistle
[other usage] Cardopatium corymbosum, 
Carthamus corymbosum, Brotera corymbosa 
— Black Chamoeleon 
Black chamaeleon has leaves similar to scolymus
hispanicus, yet they are smaller, thinner and
distinguished with red. It sends out a stalk the thickness
of a finger, twenty centimetres high, somewhat red, with
a tuft and prickly flowers — small, similar to hyacinth,
variously-coloured. The root is thick, black, compact and
sometimes eaten-into. When cut it is a pale yellow, and is
biting when chewed. It grows in dry rocky grounds and
places bordering the sea. The root (pounded into small
pieces) is mixed with a little cobblers' ink, cedar oil and
swines’ grease, and used to remove parasitic skin
diseases. It cleans away  lichen [papular skin disease],
boiled with vinegar and rubbed on (with the addition of
sulphur and bitumen). It is used as a mouthwash, and a
decoction of it soothes toothache. Wrapped in same
amount of pepper and wax it helps pained teeth. Teeth
are preserved if it is boiled with vinegar and poured on
them. Conveyed warm through a quill [straw] it breaks a
sore tooth. It cleans away vitiligines [form of leprosy] and
sunburn, is mixed with ripening medicines, and applied,
heals spreading wild ulcers, destroying them. It is called
chamaeleon because of the various colours of the leaves.
For these vary, differing according to the place, often
green, pale, azure-coloured [blue], or red. It is also called
pancarpon, ulophonum, ixia, cynomachon, ocimoides, cnidium
coccum, or cynoxylon; the Latins call it carduus nutans niger,
some, vernilago, and the Egyptians, sobel.
3-12. KROKODEILION 
SUGGESTED: Carthamus lanatus, Centaurea crocodylium 
— Blush-flowered Centaury  
Crocodilium is similar to black chamaeleon [above] but it
grows in woody places. It has a long root — light,
 378
ROOTS OF AKANTHODA or PRICKLY PLANTS 

somewhat broad, with a sharp smell, like nasturtium
[2-185]. The root warmed in water and taken as a drink is
able to drive out quantities blood through the nostrils. It
is given to the splenetic evidently helping them. The seed 
of it (round and double like a buckler [shield]) is diuretic.
3-13. DIPSAKON

Carduus fullonius [Fuchs], Dipsacus sativus [Bauhin], 
Dipsacus fullonum — Fullers’ Teazle, Draper's Teazle                    
Dipsacus sylvestris — Wild Teazle, Shepherd's Rod,
 Barber's Brushes 
Dipsacus is also a prickly plant. It has a high stalk full
of prickles, with leaves enclosing the stalk similar to
lettuce, two at every knot, tall and prickly, having (as it
were) some prickly bladders on the middle of the back
both within and without, and hollow places around the
two (joining) parts of the leaves so that it gathers water
from the dew and showers (which is how it got its name).
On the top of the stalk at every shoot there is one head
similar to a hedgehog, somewhat long and prickly. Dried
it turns white, but the head (divided) has small worms
around the middle of the pith. The root of this (boiled
with wine and pounded until the thickness of a wax
ointment) is put in to heal cracks and fistulas in the
perineum. The medicine must be stored in a brass box.
They say that it is a cure for protruding and hanging
warts. The worms from the heads (bound up in a purse
and hanged around the neck or the arm) are said to cure
those who have fevers with recurrent paroxysms. It is
also called crocodilium, chamaeleon, or onocardium, some
call it the bath of Venus, the Romans call it the lip of
Venus, some, the thistle of Venus, the Egyptians, seseneor, 
some, chir, or meleta, and the Dacians, sciare.

Acantha leuke  grows on mountains and in woody
places. It has leaves similar to white chamaeleon [3-10] 
but narrower, whiter, somewhat rough and prickly. The
stalk is over two feet (high), the thickness of the great
finger or rather more, a pale white, empty within. On the
top of it there is a prickly head similar to a sea urchin, but
smaller and somewhat long. The flowers are purple, in
which is the seed like that of cnicus  [4-119, 4-190] but
rounder. The root (taken in a drink) is good for
bloodspitters, gastritis, and the abdominal cavity, and it
encourages urine. It is laid on oedema, and a decoction of
this as a mouth rinse is good for toothache. The seed
(taken in a drink) helps convulsed children, and those
bitten by snakes. They say that worn as an amulet (by
itself) it drives away poisonous creatures. It is also called
wild cinara, donacitis, or erysisceptron, and the Romans call
it spina regia, or carduus.
3-15. AKANTHA ARABIKE
SUGGESTED: Acanthus spinosus — Oyster Plant
Acantha arabica  seems similar in nature to the white
thistle — astringent, good for excessive [menstrual]
discharges of women, the throwing-up of blood and
other discharges  — the root being similarly effective. It
grows in rough places. It is also called acanthisa, while the
Romans call it spina.

SUGGESTED: Scolymus, Cinara, Articocalus [Fuchs], 
Cinara hortensis [Bauhin], Cynara scolymus [Linnaeus]  
— Artichoke
[other usage] Spotted Golden Thistle — Scolymus maculatus
Golden Thistle, Spanish Oyster Plant — Scolymus hispanicus 
Scolymus hispanicus  has leaves like chamaeleon [3-10,
3-11], and the thorn is called white but is darker and
thicker. It puts out a long stalk full of leaves on which is a
prickly head. The root lies underneath — black, thick, its
strength good for those with a bad smell in the armpits
and the rest of the body [body odour] applied or boiled in 
wine; and taken as a drink as it draws out much stinking
urine. The new growth of the herb boiled like asparagus
is eaten instead of a vegetable. It is also called ferula, or
pyracantha, the Romans call it strobylus, and the
Egyptians, chnus.
3-17. POTERION
SUGGESTED: Poterium officinale — Great Burnet 
 Poterium sanguisorba, Sanguisorba minor — Salad Burnet 
 Astragalus poterium, Astragalus arnacantha 
— Small Goat’s Thorn 
Poterium is a large shrub with long branches — soft,
flexible like a bridle, thin, similar to tragacanth — the
leaves little, round. The whole shrub is surrounded with
a thin woolly down and is prickly; the flowers are small
and white. The seed (to one who tastes it) has a sweet
scent and is sharp with no use. It grows in sandy and hilly 
countries. The roots are underneath, two or three feet
long, strong and sinewy. When cut close to the ground
they send out a fluid similar to gum. The roots (cut and
smeared on) heal cut-apart sinews and wounds, and a
decoction of it (taken as a drink) is good for disorders of
the strength. It is also called phrynion, or andidotum, and
the Ionians call it neurada.

3-18. AKANTHION
UNKNOWN
Acanthium has leaves similar to the white thorn
[above] with prickly abnormal growths, and on top
there is down similar to a spiders web. This is gathered
and made into one (or spun), and is similar to silk. The
roots and leaves of this (taken as a drink) help one
troubled with a painfully stiff neck.
3-19. AKANTHA ERPEKANTHA
SUGGESTED: Acantha vera, [Fuchs], Acanthus sativus,
 Acanthus mollis [Bauhin, Linnaeus], Acanthus spinosus,
 — Bears Breeches 
Acantha or herpacantha grows in gardens and moist
rocky places. It has far broader, longer leaves than
lettuce, divided like those of eruca [2-170], somewhat
dark, thick and smooth. It has a smooth stalk two feet
high, the thickness of a finger towards the top,
surrounded all around by distances with certain longish
little leaves (similar to little hives) of a hyacinth colour.
From these the white seed grows out, somewhat long,
yellowish, with a head similar to a thyrsus [wand]. The
roots underneath are viscous, mouldy, reddish and long.
Applied, they are good for burns and dislocations. Taken
in a drink they encourage urine and stop discharges of
the bowels. They are good for tuberculosis of the lungs,
hernia, and convulsions. It is also called melamphyllon,
pasderota, acanthus topiaria, mamolaria, or craepula.
3-20. AKANTHA AGRIA
SUGGESTED: Acanthus spinosissimus — White-spined Akantha
The Romans call acantha sylvestris by the name of spina
agrestis. There is also a wild acantha, similar to carduus
nutans [musk thistle] — prickly, shorter than the garden
variety that is cultivated. The root of this affects as many
things as the previous one.

SUGGESTED: Anonis, Resta bovis, Remora aratri [Fuchs], 
Anonis spinosa [Bauhin], Ononis spinosa [Linnaeus] 
— Spiny Restharrow
Anonis (also called ononis) has branches twenty
centimetres long or more. It is shrubby, full of joints
with hollow wings, many round little heads, and small
little leaves, thin like the lentil, similar to those of rue
[3-52, 3-53, 4-98] or lotus. It grows in meadows and is
somewhat rough and sweet smelling, not smelling
unseemly. It is preserved in brine before the prickles
emerge, and it is very pleasant. The branches have sharp
strong prickles that are similar to arrowheads. There is a
white root that is warming and reduces the intensity of
symptoms. The bark of this (taken in a drink with wine)
removes skin, breaks up urinary stones, and emarginates
[removes the edge of] the scurf of ulcers. Boiled in posca
[hot drinks] and used as a mouth rinse it soothes
toothache, and a decoction of this (taken as a drink) is
thought to cure haemorrhoids.
3-22. LEUKAKANTHA
SUGGESTED: Chrysanthemum leucacanthemum, Leucanthemum,
[Bedevian] — Ox-eye Daisy, White Weed, Dog Daisy 
Leucacantha has a root that is similar to cyprus [1-124] —  
bitter and strong — which is chewed to lessen
toothache. Three cups of a decoction (taken as a drink
with wine) helps lung congestion that has lasted long,
sciatica, hernia, and convulsions. The juice from the root
(taken as a drink) does the same. It is also called
polygonatum, or phyllon, others call it ischias, the Romans
call it gniacardus, and the Thuscans, alba spina.
3-23. TRAGAKANTHE
SUGGESTED: Astragalus tragacantha — Gum Tragacanth Plant,
Goat’s Thorn 
Tragacantha has a root that is broad and woody
appearing above the earth. From this low strong
 387
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

branches emerge, spreading out. On them are many
small thin leaves with prickles between hidden in the
leaves — white, strong, upright. There is also a
tragacanth gum adhering to the root when it is cut. The
best is transparent, smooth, slender, clean, and
somewhat sweet. It is able like [other] gums to close the
pores. It is used for eye medicines, coughs, roughness of
the arteries; and for dripping fluids in a linctus [syrup]
with honey. It melts when put under the tongue. A
teaspoonful steeped in passum [raisin wine] is taken as a
drink for pain of the kidneys and erosion of the bladder.
Hart’s horn that has been burned and washed (or a little
allom scissile [5-123]) is also mixed with it.
3-24. ERUNGION 
SUGGESTED: Eryngium, Iringus [Fuchs], Eryngium vulgare
[Bauhin], Eryngium campestre [Linnaeus] 
— Common Eryngo, Field Eryngo, Eryngium 
Eryngium is one of the prickly plants. The new leaves
are stored in brine and eaten as vegetables. They are
broad and rough in the circumference, and aromatic to
the taste. Growing bigger they become prickly at the
furthest points of the stalks, on the tops of which are little
round heads surrounded with very sharp prickles like a
star, hard all around. The colour can be green, pale,
white, or sometimes azure [blue]. The root is long, broad,
black on the outside and white within, the thickness of a
big finger or thumb. It is sweet smelling and aromatic,
and grows in fields and rough places. It is able to warm,
and expels urine and the menstrual flow. Taken as a
drink it dissolves griping and gaseousness. It is good with 
wine for liver complaints, those bitten by venomous
creatures, and as an antidote for those who have taken a
deadly drink. It is taken in a drink for the most part with
one teaspoonful of pastinaca [3-59] seed. It is said that
used as a personal ornament or rubbed on someone it
dissolves tubercles [growths]. The root (taken as a drink
with honey water) cures tetanus and epilepsy. It is also
called erynge, eryneris, caryon, gorginium, hermium,
origanum chlunium, myracanthum, or moly. The Egyptians
call it crobysus, the Magi, siserti, the Romans, capitulum

3-25. ALOE 
SUGGESTED: Aloe [Fuchs], Aloe vulgaris [Bauhin], 
Aloe vera [Linnaeus] — Aloe
Aloe has a leaf almost like squill — thick, fat,
somewhat broad near the stem, broken or
bow-backed behind, with short, thin prickles along the
sides. It sends out a stalk similar to anthericum [3-122], has
a white flower, and seed similar to asphodelus [2-199]. All
of it has a strong scent and is very bitter to the taste. It has
only one root like a stake. It grows abundantly and
thickly in India, and the extracted juice is brought from
there. It also grows in Arabia, Asia and certain sea-
bordering places and islands as in Andros. This type is
not good for extracting juice, but suitable for closing open 
cuts, sores and wounds, pounded into small pieces and
applied. There is a thick kind of juice that is grainy, one of
which seems to have the purest substance, the other
similar to liver. Choose the pure that is undeceitful,
unstony, glittering, yellowish, brittle, like liver, easily
melted, and excels in bitterness. That which is black and
hard to break, refuse. They counterfeit it with gum —
which is noticed by the taste, the bitterness, the strength
of the smell, and because it does not fall into pieces (as
much as the smallest crumb) squeezed in the fingers.
Some mix acacia with it.
It is astringent, procures sleep, dries, thickens bodies,
loosens the intestines, and cleans the stomach, two
spoonfuls taken in a drink with cold water or warm milk.
This amount with thirty grains weight of water (or one
teaspoonful of a drink) stops the spitting of blood and
cleans jaundice. Swallowed with rosin (or taken either
with water or boiled honey) it loosens the bowels, but
three teaspoonfuls fully purges. Mixed with other
purging medicines it makes them less hurtful to the
stomach. Sprinkled on dry it heals wounds, and brings
boils to a scar and represses them. It effectively heals
ulcerated genitals, and heals the broken foreskin of boys.
Mixed with sweet wine it cures the joints and cracks in
 391
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

the perineum. It stops discharges of blood from
haemorrhoids, brings pterygium [membrane on eye] to a
scar, and takes away bruises and low blood pressure with
honey. It soothes rough skin, itchiness of the eye corners,
and headaches, rubbed with vinegar and rosaceum [1-53]
on the forehead and the temples. With wine it stops the
hair falling off [ alopecia]; and with honey and wine it is
good for the tonsils, as well as the gums and all sores in
the mouth. It is roasted for eye medicines in a clean,
red-hot ceramic jar, turned continuously until it is
roasted evenly. It is then washed, the sandy part
separated as useless, and the most fat and smooth taken.
It is also called amphibion, eryngium, herminum, or
tragoceros; the Romans call it aloa, and the Barbarians, aloe.
3-26. APSINTHION 
SUGGESTED: Absinthium vulgare [Fuchs], Seriphium absinthium
[in Sprague], Artemisia absinthium [Linnaeus] — Wormwood 
NARCOTIC
Absinthium (also called bathypicron) is a well-known
herb, and the best grows in Pontus and Cappadocia
on the mountain called Taurus. It is warming, astringent
and digestive, and takes away bilious matter sticking in
the stomach and bowels. It is urinary, and keeps one from 
overindulging taken as a drink beforehand. It is good
(taken as a drink with seseli [3-60 to 3-62] or celtic nardus
[1-7]) for gaseousness and pains in the intestines and
stomach. Three cups of a dilution or decoction of it (taken
every day) heals lack of appetite and jaundice. Taken as a
drink and applied with honey it expels the menstrual
flow. It is good with vinegar for constrictions from
[eating] mushrooms. It is an antidote given with wine for
(the poison) of ixia [3-103] and hemlock, the bites of the
shrewmouse, and bites of the sea dragon [2-15]. With
honey and saltpetre [potassium nitrate] it is an ointment
for a synanchic [ abscessed] throat; and with water for
pustules that appear at night. It is used for bruises with
honey, also for dullness of sight [eyes] and pus-filled ears. 
The vapour of a decoction is used for earache and
toothache. Boiled with passum [raisin wine] it is a plaster
for very painful eyes. It is also applied to hypochondria
[nervous gastric disorder], the liver, a painful stomach,

and [those] who have suffered long pounded together
with Cyprian [possibly rose] wax ointment, but for the
stomach mix it with rosaceum [1-53]. It is good for dropsy
and the spleen mixed with figs, saltpetre [potassium
nitrate] and meal of lolium [2-116, 4-140]. 
Especially around Propontis and Thrace a wine is
made from it which is called absinthe, which they use in
the absence of fever for the purposes previously
mentioned. They drink to each other with it in the
summer thinking it to cause health. It seems that placed
in chests it keeps the garments uneaten [by moths].
Rubbed on with oil it forbids the mosquitos to touch the
body [insect repellant]. Ink for writing that is made by
steeping it keeps writings from being eaten by mice. It
seems that the juice does the same work. We do not allow 
it in liquid medicines as it is bad for the stomach and
causes headaches. Some counterfeit the juice with boiled
amurca [sediment of buckthorn oil]. The Egyptians call it
somi, and the Romans, absinthium rusticum.
3-27. APSINTHION THALASSION 
SUGGESTED: Artemisia maritima, Artemisia pauciflora 
— Sea Wormwood, Garden Cypress, Sea Artemisia 
Absinthium marinum  (also called seriphion) grows
abundantly in the Taurus Mountains around
Cappadocia and in Taphosiris, Egypt. The Isiaci use it
instead of an olive branch. The herb has thin branches
similar to the small abrotanum [3-29] with abundant little
seeds, somewhat bitter, bad for the stomach, and with a
strong smell. It is astringent with some heating, and
boiled by itself (or with rice) and taken with honey it kills
ascaridae [threadworms] and roundworms, loosening the
bowels gently. It does the same things with sapa [new
wine syrup] or boiled together with lentils. Cattle grow
very fat feeding on it [ fodder]. It is also called sandonion,
or seriphum; the Romans call it santonicum.

SANTONION
SUGGESTED: Artemisia santonicum — Holy Wormwood 
 Artemisia glacialis — Silky Wormwood, Glacier Wormwood 
There is a third kind of wormwood that grows
abundantly in Galatia (or rather Gallia) near the Alps, 
which they call by the place’s name — santonicum, giving
it this surname from its growing in the country of
Sardonis. It is similar to wormwood, not as seedy,
somewhat bitter, and able to do the same things as the
Seriphian [3-27].
3-29. ABROTONON 
SUGGESTED: Abrotonum foemina [Fuchs], Absinthium ponticum
[Bauhin], Artemisia pontica, Abrotanum mas [Linnaeus],
Artemisia abrotanum — Southernwood 
The female abrotanum is a tree-like shrub, somewhat
white, the leaves with little in-cuts (like those of
seriphium) around the branches, with a golden corymbus
[flat or slightly convex inflorescence] on the top, full of
flowers that display in the summer, with a sweet smell,
and some strength, bitter in taste. This seems to be the
Sicilian. The other (called male) is full of sprigs, with
slender seeds like wormwood. It grows abundantly in
Cappadocia, and Galatia in Asia, and Hierapolis in Syria.
The seed of these (pounded raw, boiled, and taken in a
drink of water) helps difficult breathing, hernia,
convulsions, sciatica, difficult painful urination, and the
stoppage of the menstrual flow. Taken in a drink of wine
it is an antidote for deadly poisons. With oil it is an
ointment for those who have chills. It drives away snakes
scattered under [foot] or inhaled as smoke. Taken in a
drink of wine it helps those who are bitten. It is
particularly good for the strikes of the harvest spider and
scorpions. It helps inflammation of the eyes applied with
boiled quince or with bread. It dissolves pannus [opaque
thickening of cornea with veins; eyes] pounded into
small pieces and boiled with barley meal. It is also mixed
in the composition of oil irinum [1-66]. It is also called
abutonon, absinthium, heraclion, cholopoeon, thelyphthorion,

cubitus.
3-30. USSOPOS 
SUGGESTED: Hyssopus hortensis [Fuchs]
 Hyssopus officinalis [Linnaeus] — Hyssop
Origanum syriacum —Hyssop of the Bible [Mabberley]
Hyssopus (a well-known herb) is of two sorts — one
mountainous, the other grown in gardens. The best 
grows in Cilicia. It is able to reduce the intensity of
symptoms and warms. Boiled with figs, water, honey
and rue [3-52, 3-53, 4-98], and taken as a drink it helps
pneumonia, asthma, internal coughs, mucus, and
orthopnoea [type of asthma], and kills worms. Licked
with honey it does the same. A decoction (taken as a
drink with vinegar and honey) expels thick fluids
through the bowels. It is eaten with green figs (pounded
into small pieces) for emptying the intestines, but it
purges more forcibly mixed with cardamom, iris, or irio
[irinum? 1-66]. It causes a good colour. It is daubed on
with figs and saltpetre [potassium nitrate] for the spleen
and dropsy, but with wine for inflammation. Applied
with warm water it dissolves bruises. With a decoction of
figs it is an excellent gargle for a synanchic [abscessed]
throat. Boiled with vinegar and used as a lotion it soothes
toothache. The smoke being inhaled, it dissolves
windiness around the ears. The Latins call it hyssopum, it
is also called  later or cassiala, and the Egyptians call it
pesalem.
3-31. STOICHAS
SUGGESTED: Stichas, Stichas arabica [Fuchs], 
Stoechas purpurea [Bauhin], Lavandula stoechas 
— French Lavender, Spanish Lavender 
Stoechas grows in the Islands of Galatia near Messalia
called the Stoechades, which is how it got its name. It
is a herb with slender twigs and filaments similar to
thyme, but longer-leaved, sharp to the taste, and
 399
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK
Lavandula stoechas
after WINKLER — 1891

somewhat bitter. A decoction of it (like hyssop [3-30]) is
good for disorders in the chest. It is useful mixed with
antidotes. It is also called syncliopa, alcibiades, pancration or
styphonia; the Egyptians call it suphlo, the Magi, oculus
pythonis, the Romans, schiolebina.
3-32. ORIGANOS ERAKLEOTIKE
SUGGESTED: Origanum heracleoticum [Loudon] 
— Winter-sweet Marjoram
Origanum heracleoticum (also called conila) has a leaf
similar to hyssop [3-30], and a tuft not of a round
shape but (as it were) divided, and on the tops of the
sprigs, the seed, not thick. It is warming; as a result a
decoction of it (taken as a drink with wine) is good for
those bitten by poisonous beasts. It is given as an antidote 
with passum [raisin wine] for those who have taken a
drink of hemlock or meconium [4-65], and with vinegar
and honey for those who have taken a drink of gypsum
or ephemerum [4-85]. For convulsions, hernia, and dropsy
it is eaten with a fig. It is dried and the amount of an
acetabulum [vinegar cruet] taken in a drink with honey
and water to expel black (fluids) through the bowels.
Licked in with honey it induces the menstrual flow and
cures coughs. A decoction of it in a bath is good for prurigo
[chronic itching], psoriasis and jaundice. The juice of the
green herb cures tonsils, [inflammation of the] uvula, and 
apthae [aptha — infant thrush or candidiasis]. Dropped in
with oil irinum [1-66] it purges through the nostrils. With
milk it also soothes earache. A vomitory medicine is made 
from it with onions and rhus [1-147], all of them being
sunned in the burning heat under the dog [in summer] in 
a brass copper jar for forty days. The herb scattered
under[foot] expels snakes. 
3-33. ORIGANOS ONITIS 
SUGGESTED: Origanum onitis — Pot Marjoram 
That which is called onitis is paler in the leaves,
resembles hyssop [3-30] more, and has seed like
berries hanging together. It can do the same things as the
Heracleotic [3-32]. Yet it is not altogether as effective.

Origanum vulgare [Linnaeus] — Wild Marjoram, Organy
Origanum sylvestre  has leaves similar to origanum,
but the thin stems are twenty centimetres high, on
which are tufts similar to dill. The flowers are white; the
root thin, ineffective. The leaves and flowers (taken in a
drink with wine) effectively help those bitten by snakes.
It is also called panaces heraclion, others call it cunila, as well 
as nicander colophonius.

Tragoriganum is a little shrub similar to origanum or
wild serpyllum [3-46] in its leaves and small branches.
Some is found that is more prosperous and broader-
leaved, gluey enough, depending on the location.
Another (which is also called prasium) has small shoots
and thin leaves. The best is the Cilician and those in Co,
Chios, Smyrna, and Crete. All are warming, urinary, and
good for the intestines (in a decoction taken as a drink)
for they drive down depression. Taken in a drink with
vinegar they are effective for the spleen, and are given as
an antidote with wine for those who have taken a drink
of ixia [3-103]. They expel the menstrual flow, and are
given as linctuses [syrups] with honey for coughs and
pneumonia. A liquid medicine of it is mild; as a result it is
given to the squeamish, for gastric [disorders], unsavoury 
belchers, and those who have seasickness, nausea and
heartburn. It dissolves oedema applied with polenta.

SUGGESTED: Pulegium [Fuchs], Pulegium foemina [Brunfels],
Pulegium latifolium [Bauhin],  Mentha pulegium [Linnaeus],
Pulegium vulgare, Glechon [Latin] — Pennyroyal,
 Pudding Grass 
Glechium (a well-known herb) reduces the intensity of 
symptoms and is warming and digestive. Taken as a 
drink it expels the menstrual flow and the afterbirth, and
is an abortifacient.  Taken as a drink with salt and honey it 
brings up stuff out of the lungs and helps the convulsed. 
Taken as a drink with posca [hot drinks] it soothes nausea
and gnawing of the stomach. It draws out depressive
matter through the intestines, and taken as a drink with
wine it helps those bitten by snakes. Applied with
vinegar to the nostrils it restores those who faint.
Pounded dry and burnt, it strengthens the gums. Rubbed 
on with polenta it soothes all inflammation. By itself it is
good for gout (applied) until redness appears. With waxy 
ointments it extinguishes varos [smallpox pustules]. It is
also good for the spleen applied with salt. A decoction
soothes itching washed on, and it is good as a bath for
gaseousness, hardness, and inversions of the womb. It is
also called blechon because when cattle taste it at its
flowering time they are filled with bleating.
It is also called blechron, or arsenicanthon; the Romans
call it polium, the Africans, apoleium, the Gauls, albolon,
and some, gallisopsis.
3-37. DIKTAMNON
SUGGESTED: Dictamnus albus, Dictamnus fraxinella 
— White Dittany, Gas Plant, Candle Plant, Fraxinella 
Origanum dictamnus, Dictamnus creticus, Amaracus dictamnus
— Dittany of Crete 
Dictamnus is a Cretian herb — sharp, smooth, similar
to pulegium [3-36]. It has bigger leaves, downy, with
a kind of woolly adherence, but it bears neither flower
nor seed. It does all the things that the cultivated pulegium
does but much more forcibly, for not only taken as a
drink but also applied and inhaled as smoke, it expels
dead embryos. They say that goats in Crete having fed on

the herb reject arrows if shot [wounds]. The juice rubbed
on (alone or with polenta) is cleansing. The herb is
applied to cure prickles under the feet, or [on] the rest of
the body. It is also effective for a painful spleen, for it
lessens it. They gather it in the summer and the fall. The
root warms those who taste it. It is also a birth-hastener,
and the juice (taken as a drink with wine) helps those
bitten by snakes. Such is the strength of this herb that
even the smell drives away poisonous beasts, and the
touch kills them. The juice dropped into a wound caused
by iron, or the bite of a poisonous beast (and as well as
dropping it on, if it is taken in drink), immediately cures.
(Rub dried dictamnus in your hands until it is similar to 
meal, throw in a drop of wine and apply it to your body.
It is good against all snakes. It first cleans ulcers and
rotten, gangrenous ulcerations, and then it fills them up.
If one is pricked apply this to him and immediately you
shall help him. Having made meal of it, apply it for the
spleen and disorders from inflammation in hidden
places. Dig up the herb in the spring, the hot seasons, and 
in the autumn.) It is also called pulegium sylvestre,
embactron, beluacos, artemedion, creticus, ephemeron, eldian,
belotocos, dorcidium, or elbunium; the Romans call it ustilago 
rustica.

That which is called pseudodictamnus grows in many
places and is similar to the one above but less sharp.
It does the same things as dictamnus, but is not similarly
effective.

has leaves similar to sisymbrium [2-155], but with
bigger branches, and a flower similar to wild origanum — 
black and soft. The smell of the leaves is most pleasant,
between sisymbrium and sage. It is effective for all things
(as that above) but somewhat less biting. It is mixed with
plasters and antidotal medicines.
3-40. ELELISPHAKON 
SUGGESTED: Salvia maior, Salvia minor [Fuchs, Bauhin],
 Salvia officinalis [Linnaeus] — Sage
Helelisphacum is a much-branched somewhat long
shrub, with four-square and somewhat white
stalks. The leaves are similar to malicottoon [1-160], yet
longer, sharper and thicker, hidden by filaments —
whitish, especially odiferous and poisonous-smelling —
like on outworn garments. The seed is on top of the stalks
like wild horminum [3-145]. It grows in rough places. A
decoction of the leaves and branches (taken as a drink) is
able to induce movement of the urine and the menstrual
flow, is an abortifacient, and helps the strikes of the
pastinaca marina [2-22].  It dyes the hair black, is a wound
herb and a blood-stauncher, and cleanses wild ulcers. A
decoction of the leaves and branches (with wine) applied
with hot cloths soothes itchiness around the genitals.
Elelisphacon dissolves chilliness and coughs and is good
used with rosaceum [1-53] and wax ointment for all bad
ulcers. Taken as a drink with white wine it cures a painful
spleen and dysentery. Similarly, given to drink it cures
bloodspitters, and is available for all cleansing for a
woman, but the most wicked women (making a pessary
of it) apply it and use it as an abortifacient. It is also called
elaphoboscon, sphagnon, ciosmin, phagnon, or becion; the
Egyptians call it apusi, the Romans, cosalon, and others,
salvia.

SUGGESTED: Mentha sativa [Linnaeus], Mentha viridis
—  Common Mint, Spearmint, Whorled Mint 
 Mentha piperita — White Mint, Peppermint 
Hedyosmus is a well-known little herb that is
warming, astringent, and drying. As a result the
juice of it (taken as a drink with vinegar) stops blood, kills
roundworms, and encourages lust [aphrodisiac]. Two or
three little sprigs (taken in a drink with the juice of a sour
pomegranate) soothe hiccups, vomiting, and bile.
Applied with polenta it dissolves suppurations. Applied
to the forehead it eases headaches. It soothes the swelling 
and extension of the breasts, and with salt it is a poultice
for dog bites. The juice with honey and water helps
earache. Applied to women before sexual intercourse, it
causes inconception. Rubbed on, it makes a rough tongue 
smooth. It keeps milk from curdling if the leaves are
steeped in it. Finally, it is good for the stomach and fit for
sauce. It is also called mentha; the Romans call it menta,
some, nepeta, the Egyptians, tis, others call it pherthumer-
thrumonthu, perxo, or macetho.
3-42. EDUOSMOS AGRIOS

Mentha gentilis, Calamintha arvensis [Bauhin] — Wild Mint,
Horse Mint
[other usage] Mentastro [Italian], Marrubium vulgare 
— Common White Horehound

The wild hedyosmus (which the Romans call
mentastrum) has rougher leaves, is altogether bigger
than sisymbrium [2-155], more poisonous to smell, and
less suitable for use in health.

3-43. KALAMINTHE 
SUGGESTED: Calamintha tertium genus [Fuchs], 
Conyza media asteris [Bauhin], Inula dysenterica [Linnaeus],
Pulicaria dysenterica [in Sprague] — Fleabane
Calamintha nepeta, Nepeta cataria [Linnaeus]— Catmint,
Catnip, Nep
Calamintha officinalis, Melissa calamintha 
— Common Calamint, Cat Mint
Some calamintha is more mountainous, and has whitish 
leaves similar to basil, with the sprigs and stalks
angular, and a purple flower. The other sort is similar to
pulegium [3-36] yet bigger, as a result some have called it
pulegium agreste, because it also has a similar smell. The
Romans call this nepeta. The third sort is similar to wild
mint, longer in the leaves, bigger than that previously
mentioned in the stalk and branch, and it is less effective.
The leaves of all of them are strongly warming and sharp
to the taste: the roots are not effective. It grows in plain
fields and rough watery places. Taken as a drink (or
applied) it helps those bitten by snakes. A decoction
(taken as a drink) induces the passing of urine, and helps
hernia, convulsions, orthopnoea [form of asthma],
griping, bile, and chills. Taken as a drink (beforehand)
with wine it is an antidote against poisons and cleans
away jaundice. Pounded into small pieces (either boiled
or raw) and taken as a drink with salt and honey it kills
both roundworms and threadworms. Eaten with the
whey of milk and taken as a drink (afterwards) it helps
those with elephantiasis. The leaves pounded into small
pieces and given in a pessary are an abortifacient and
expel the menstrual flow. Inhaled as smoke or scattered
underfoot it drives away snakes. Boiled in wine and
applied, it makes black scars white and takes away
bruises. It is applied to sciatica for a medicine to eliminate
waste or morbid matter, burning the outward skin. The
juice is dropped in the ears to kill worms.

SUGGESTED:Thymus angustifolius, Thymus glaber 
— Wild Thyme, Mother of Thyme 
Everyone knows thyme. It is a little shrub full of
branches surrounded with many narrow little leaves, 
and little heads with flowers resembling purple on the
top. It grows chiefly in rocky and barren places. Taken as
a drink with salt and vinegar it is able to drive out
phlegmy matter through the bowels. A decoction with
honey helps orthopnoea [form of asthma] and the
asthmatic, expels worms and the menstrual flow, is an
abortifacient, expels the afterbirth, and is urinary. Mixed
with honey and taken as a linctus [syrup] it makes matter
come up [ vomitory]. Applied with vinegar it dissolves
new swellings and clots of blood, and takes away thymos
[hormonal glandular enlargement] and hanging warts.
Applied with wine and polenta it is good for hip pains.
Eaten with meat it is good for poor vision. It is good
instead of sauce for use in health. It is also called white
thyme, cephalotus, epithumis, or thyrsium; the Romans call
it thymus, the Egyptians, stephane, and the Dacians,
mozula. 
3-45. THUMBRA 
SUGGESTED: Sisymbrium [Pliny] see 2-155, Serpyllum sylvestre
[Fuchs], Serpyllum vulgare minus [Bauhin], Thymus serpyllum
[Linnaeus] — Creeping Thyme, Wild Thyme,
 Mother of Thyme
Thymbra is also well known. It grows in barren and
rough places — similar to thyme, only smaller and
more tender, and bearing a stalk full of flowers of a
greenish colour. It can do the same things as thyme
(taken the same way) and it is suitable for use in health.
There is also a cultivated satureia, of less value in
everything than the wild, yet more effective for meat
[sauce] because it does not have as much sharpness.

3-46. ERPULLOS, ERPULLOS ZOGIS
SUGGESTED: Thymus, Serpyllum romanum [Fuchs],
 Thymus vulgaris [Linnaeus] — Garden Thyme,
 Potherb Thyme 
Herpyllum is the garden kind, similar to sampsuchum
[3-47] in smell, and used for making wreaths for the
head. It is so-called from its creeping, and because if any
part of it touches the earth, there it roots. It has leaves and 
small branches similar to origanum, yet whiter. Trailed
down from unmortared walls it becomes more abundant. 
The other is wild and is called zygis — not creeping but
upright, sending out thin branches full of sprigs,
surrounded with leaves similar to rue, yet they are
narrow, longer, and harder. The flower is sharp to the
taste, sweet to the smell, the root useless. It grows on
rocks, being stronger and hotter than the garden kind
and more suitable for medicinal use. Taken in a drink it
expels the menstrual flow and causes an urge to urinate.
It helps griping, hernia, convulsions, inflammation of the
liver and snakebites taken as a drink and applied. Boiled
with vinegar (with rosaceum [1-53] mixed in there) and
the head moistened with it, soothes headaches. It is
especially good for lethargy and frenzy. Four
teaspoonfuls of the juice (taken as a drink with vinegar)
stop the vomiting of blood. It is also called zygis sylvestris,
or polion, the Egyptians call it meruopyos, the Romans,
serpyllum, others, cicer erraticum.
3-47. SAMPSUCHON
SUGGESTED: Sampsuchum, Sampsucum, Origanum majorum
[Pliny],  Amaracus, Maiorana [Fuchs], Majorana vulgaris
[Bauhin], Origanum majorana [Linneaus], 
 Origanum majoranoides, Majorana hortensis 
— Sweet Marjoram, Knotted Marjoram
The best sampsuchum is the Cyzicenian and the
Cyprian, but the Egyptian is second to this. It is a
herb with many branches that creeps along the earth,
with round rough leaves similar to thin-leaved calamint,
very fragrant and heating. It is plaited into wreaths for
the head. A decoction (taken as a drink) is good for those

who are beginning to have dropsy, and for frequent
painful urination, and griping. The dry leaves are
smeared on with honey to take away bruises. In a pessary 
they drive out the menstrual flow; and they are rubbed
on with salt and vinegar for the strike of a scorpion. For
dislocations and oedema they are applied with a wax
ointment. They are rubbed on with flour of polenta for
inflammation, and mixed with medications to remove
fatigue, and with softening medicines for warmth’s sake.
The Cyzicenians and those in Sicily call it amaracum. It is
also called trifolium, amaracum, agathides, cnecion, or
acapnon; Pythagoras calls it thrambes, the Egyptians, sopho, 
the Armenians, myurum, the Magi call it the ass of the
priest, others, genitura Isidis, and the Romans, maiorana.
3-48. MELILOTOS
SUGGESTED: Melilotus italica, Meliloti quartum genus [Fuchs],
Trifolium melilotus corniculata [Linnaeus], 
Trigonella corniculata, Trigonella elatior — Wild Trefoil
[other usage] Melilotus officinalis, Melilotus arvensis,
 Corona regia, Trifolium melilotus officinalis — Honey Lotus,
King’s Clover, Melilot 
The best melilotus is the Attic [Athenian] and that
which grows in Chalcedon — similar to saffron, with
a sweet scent. It also grows in Campania around Nola,
inclining to yellow, and weak regarding the sweet smell. 
It is a powerful astringent, and boiled with passum
[raisin wine] and applied, softens all inflammation —
especially that around the eyes, womb, buttocks and
anus, and the stones [ testicles]. Sometimes the roasted
yolk of an egg is mixed with it, or the meal of fenugreek,
hemp seed, wheat flour, the heads of poppies, or intybus
[2-160]. Used alone in water it also cures new melicerides
[encysted tumour with honey-like exudation], as well as
scaly eruptions on the scalp, rubbed on with Chian [from
Scios in the Aegean sea] earth and wine or galls [oak
galls]. For pain in the stomach boil it with wine or use it
raw with some of the things previously mentioned.
Juiced raw and dropped in the ears with passum [raisin
wine] it eases earache, and when let fall on [the head]
gently with vinegar and rosaceum [1-53] it soothes

the Magi, thermuthin; the Egyptians call it haemith, and the 
Romans, sertula, or trypatium.
3-49. MARON
SUGGESTED: Teucrium marum — Marum Germander,
 Cat Thyme
Marum or hysobrium is a well-known herb full of
sprigs, similar in the flower to origanum, but the
leaves of this are much paler, and the flower sweeter. It
has abilities similar to sisymbrium [2-155] — somewhat
astringent and gently heating. Applied, it stops
gangrenous ulceration, and it is mixed with the hot
ingredients of compound ointments. It grows in
abundance both near Magnesia and near Tralles. It is also
called origanis.
3-50. AKINOS
SUGGESTED: Thymus acinos, Ocimum pilosum, 
Acinos vulgaris —  Acinos 
see 3-109, 4-28, 4-176
Acinus or aconus is a herb with a small stalk used in
making wreaths for the head, similar to basil but
rougher. It has a sweet scent, and is also sown in gardens
by some. Taken as a drink it stops discharges of the
intestines, and the menstrual flow. Applied, it heals both
pannus [opaque thickening of cornea with veins] and
erysipela [ streptococcal skin infection]. It is also called
basilicum sylvestre, and the Romans call it ocimastrum. 
3-51. BAKCHARIS

are sharp, in size between the violet and verbascum
[4-104]; the stalk angular, a foot in height, somewhat
sharp, with suckers. The flowers are a purple colour,
whitish and sweet smelling, and the roots are similar to
those of black veratrum [4-151], and similar in smell to
cinnamon. It loves rough, dry places.  Boiled in water the
root helps convulsions, hernia, falls from on high, hard
breathing, obstinate coughs, and painful urination. It
expels the menstrual flow, and is usefully given with
wine to those bitten by snakes. One of the tender roots
(applied as a pessary) is an abortifacient, and a decoction
of it is good for bathing women in childbirth. It is good in
scented powders, having a very fragrant smell. The
leaves are astringent, and are applied to help headaches,
inflammation of the eyes, ulcers of the eyes as they begin,
breasts inflamed from childbearing, and erysipela
[streptococcal skin infection]. The smell is sleep-
inducing.

Ruta hortensis [Fuchs, Bauhin], Ruta graveolens [Linnaeus] 
— Common Rue, Herb of Grace 
CAUTION — ALLERGIC REACTIONS— OVERDOSE TOXIC OR FATAL
see 3-53, 4-98
Mountainous wild rue is sharper than the tame or
garden rue and unfit for eating. Of the garden
kind the fittest for eating grows near fig trees. Both are
sharp, warming, ulcerating, diuretic, and bring out the
menstrual flow. Eaten (or taken as a drink) they are
astringent to the bowels. An acetabulum [vinegar cruet] of
the seed (taken as a drink in wine) is an antidote for
deadly medicines. The leaves eaten (beforehand) by
themselves or with carya [1-178] or dry figs make poisons
ineffective. The same is taken against snakebites, and
either eaten or taken as a drink it extinguishes conception 
[abortifacient]. Boiled with dried dill and taken as a drink
it stops griping. It is good taken as a drink  for pain in the
sides of the chest, hard breathing, coughs, lung

inflammation, pains in the hips and joints, and periodical
chills (as previously mentioned). For gaseousness of the
colus [colic], vulva, rectum, and intestines it is boiled with
oil and given as a suppository. Pounded into small pieces
with honey and applied from the genitals to the
perineum, it also cures constriction of the womb. Boiled
in oil and taken as a drink it expels worms. It is applied
with honey for painful joints, and with figs for dropsy
under the skin. Boiled in wine until half the amount
remains then taken as a drink (and also rubbed on) it
helps these [problems] also. Eaten raw or pickled it is a
sight-restorer, and applied with polenta it soothes pains
in the eyes. Pounded fine and applied with rosaceum
[1-53] and vinegar it helps headaches and stops bloody
discharges from the nostrils. Applied with bay leaves it
helps inflammation from stones [urinary, kidney]. With
myrtle wax ointment it helps rashes such as measles.
Rubbed on all over with wine, pepper and saltpetre
[potassium nitrate] it heals white vitiligo [type of leprosy], 
and applied with the same things it takes away warty
abnormal growths and myrmecias [warts resembling an
anthill]. Applied with honey and allom [5-123] it is good
for lichenae [ skin disease]. The juice warmed in a
pomegranate rind and dropped in the ears is good for ear
sores. Rubbed on with juice of marathrum [3-81] and
honey it helps dullness of sight. Rubbed on with vinegar,
cerussa [white lead ore] and rosaceum [1-53] it cures
erysipela [ streptococcal skin infection], herpes [ viral skin
infection], and scaly eruptions on the scalp. Chewed, it
stops the bad smells that come [from eating] garlic and
onions. It is also called rhyten montana; the Romans call it
ruta montana or ruta hortense, the Egyptians, epnubu, the
Syrians, harmala, some, besasa and the Africans, churma.
The hilly rue kills, eaten too much. Gathered around
flowering time for pickling it makes the skin red, and
puffs it up with itching and extreme inflammation.They
ought, having first rubbed [protection on] the face and
the hands, so to gather it. They say that the juice
sprinkled on chicken keeps off the cats. They say that
eaten, the rue that grows in Macedonia by the river
Haliacmon kills; but that place is mountainous and full of
vipers. Taken in a drink the seed is good for disorders
within, and it is usefully mixed with antidotes. Having
dried the seed, give it to drink for seven days to one who
sheds his water [dehydration] and it shall cease. The root

of it is called mountain moly. The wild rue therefore is
similar to the cultivated, and it is good (taken in a drink)
for epilepsy and pains in the hips. It induces the
menstrual flow and is an abortifacient. It is sharper than
the cultivated and more effective in use. But you must
not eat the wild because it is hurtful. 
Ruta sylvestris is also called hypericon, androsaemon,
corion, or chamepitys; the Romans call it hederalis, others,

 Asplenium ruta-muriara — Wall Rue 
 Peganum harmala — Wild Rue, Syrian Rue, Harmel 
see 3-52, 4-98
Some call ruta sylvestris (both that in Cappadocia and
that in Galatia near Asia) moly. It is a shrub that brings
out many shoots from one root, with much longer more
tender leaves than the other rue. It has a strong scent and
white flowers, and on the top, little heads a little bigger
than the cultivated rue, consisting especially of three
parts, in which is a three-cornered seed of a faint yellow,
extremely bitter to the taste. Use is made of this. The seed
ripens in the autumn. Pounded into small pieces with
honey, wine, the gall of hens, saffron, and marathrum
[3-81] juice it is good for dullness of the sight. 
It is also called harmala; the Syrians call it besasa, the
Egyptians, epnubu, Africans, churwa and the
Cappadocians, moly, because in some ways it is similar to
moly (having a black root and white flowers) and it grows
in hilly fertile places.

colour, less in quantity than those of the violet. It has a
white stalk of four feet, on the top of which stands
something similar to garlic. The root is small, in the shape
of a scallion [2-179]. This is very good, pounded with
flour of lolium [2-116, 4-140] and inserted as a pessary for
openings of the womb. The herb moly (cut up by the root
and carried around the body) is good against poisoning
and bewitching. It is also called leucoion sylvestre.
3-55. PANAKES HERAKLEION
SUGGESTED: Heracleum panaces — Fig-leaved Cow Parsnip 
 Heracleum sphondylium — Common Cow Parsnip 
 Heracleum gummiferum, Heracleum pubescens,
 Heracleum pyrenaicum — Downy Cow Parsnip 
Panances heracleum (from which opopanax is gathered)
grows in abundance in Boeotia, and Psophis in
Arcadia. It is carefully cultivated in gardens for the
benefit that comes from the juice. It has rough green
leaves lying on the ground, coming very near to those of
the fig, jagged five-fold in the circumference. It has a very 
high stalk (like a ferula) with white down and smaller
leaves around it, and a long tuft on the top like dill. It has
yellowish flowers. The seed smells sweet and acrid. The
many white strong-smelling roots emerge from one
beginning, with thick bark and a somewhat bitter taste. It
also grows in Cyrene, Libya, and in Macedonia. The root
is juiced after being cut when the stalks are newly-
emerged. It sends out a white juice that, dried, has a
saffron colour on the outside. To remove the liquid from
the leaves they lay them beforehand on a hollow dug in
the ground and pick them up them when dry. They also
juice the stalk, cutting it at harvest time and taking out
the liquid the same way. The best roots are stretched out,
white, dry, not worm-eaten, hot to the taste, and
aromatic. The seed that comes from the middle of the
stalk is good, for that which comes from the sprigs is less
nourished. The [dried] juice that excels is the most bitter
to the taste, inside indeed white and somewhat red, but
outside a saffron colour, smooth, fat, brittle, fit for use,
melting quickly, and with a strong scent; but the black
and soft is worthless as it is adulterated with ammoniacum
[3-98] or wax. Being rubbed in water with the fingers tests

it, for the counterfeited dissolves and becomes similar to
milk. It is warming and softening, and reduces the
intensity of symptoms. As a result, taken as a drink with
honey and water (or wine) it is good for periods of acute
fevers and chills, convulsions, hernia, pains in the side,
coughs, griping, parasitic diseases in the bladder, and
slow painful urination. Dissolved with honey it induces
the menstrual flow, is an abortifacient, and scatters
gaseousness and hardness in the womb. It is an ointment
for hip pains. It is mixed with [medicines for] removal of
fatigue, and with head medicines. It breaks carbuncles all
around, and rubbed on with raisin clusters it is good for
gout. It soothes toothache put into tooth cavities, and is
rubbed on as a sight-restorer for the eyes. Mixed with
pitch it is an excellent plaster for those bitten by mad
dogs, and the root shaved and applied to the vulva is an
abortifacient. Pounded into small pieces and rubbed on
with honey it is effective for old ulcers, and applied it
covers exposed bones with flesh. The seed (taken with
wormwood [3-26]) induces the menstrual flow, and with
aristolochia [3-4, 3-5, 3-6] it is good for the bites of
poisonous beasts. It is taken as a drink with wine for
constriction of the womb.

Panaces Aesculapij sends a thin stalk of a foot’s length 
(distinguished by knots) out of the earth, around
which are leaves similar to marathrum [3-81], yet bigger,
rougher, and fragrant; and on the top is a tuft on which
are sharp, fragrant flowers of a golden colour. The root is
small. The flowers and seeds applied pounded into small
pieces with honey, have a medicinal quality suitable for
ulcers, pannus [opaque thickening of cornea with veins],
and spreading ulcers. For snakebites it is taken as a drink
with wine and rubbed on with oil. Some call [this] panaces
wild origanum, some again call it cunila (where it is
referred to in the section on origanum).

Chiron was a centaur, teacher of Aesculapius [see above].
Panaces Chironion  grows chiefly on the mountain
Pelius. It has leaves similar to amaracus [white
dittany], gold flowers, and a slender shallow root that is
sharp to the taste. Taken in a drink the root is able to act
against snakes’ poison; and the filaments are also applied
effectively for the same purposes.

Ligusticum grows most plentifully in Liguria on the
Apennine, a hill bordering on the Alps (from which it 
has its name). The inhabitants call it panaces not without
reason since the root and the stalk are similar to the
Heracleotic [3-55] panaces, and their strength is the same.
It grows on the highest, roughest, shadowy mountains,
but especially in places dug in the earth. It bears a thin
knotty stalk similar to dill, around which are leaves
similar to those of melilot [3-48], yet more tender and
fragrant. Those near the top stalk are more slender and
cut-in. On the top is a tuft on which is the seed — black,
sound, somewhat long, like that of marathrum [3-81], but
sharp and aromatic to the taste. The root is white, similar
to the Heracleotic panaces, fragrant.
The seed and roots are heating and digestive. They
are good for internal pains, digestion, oedema,
gaseousness, disorders of the stomach (especially), and
strikes from poisonous beasts. Taken in a drink it makes
urine pass, as well as the menstrual flow. The root
applied does the same. The roots and the seed are
effective mixed with oxypota [oxymel — vinegar and
honey drink] and digestive medicines. It is excellent for

the stomach; as a result the inhabitants use it instead of
pepper, mixing it with their sauces. A certain seed similar
to it, which you shall discern by the taste, for it is bitter,
counterfeits it. Some counterfeit it mixing together with it 
the seed of fennel or seseli. It is also called panacea or
panaces.
3-59. STAPHULINOS AGRIOS,
STAPHULINOS KEPAIOS
SUGGESTED: Staphylinum  [Pliny], Pastinaca sativa prima,
Pastinaca erratica, Carota [Fuchs], Daucus officinarum [Bauhin],
Daucus carota var sativa [Linnaeus] — Carrot
Daucus carota var sylvestris — Wild Carrot
Staphylinum has leaves like  gingidium, only broader
and somewhat bitter. It has a rough upright stalk
with a tuft similar to dill on which are white flowers, and
in the midst something small of a purple colour and of
almost a saffron colour. The root is the thickness of a
finger, twenty centimetres long, sweet smelling and
edible (boiled as a vegetable). The seed induces the
menstrual flow, taken as a drink (or inserted as a
pessary), and is good in liquid medicines for frequent
painful urination, dropsy, and pleurisy, as well as for the
bites and strikes of venomous creatures. They also say
that those who take it beforehand shall experience no
assault from wild beasts. It encourages conception. The
root (also being urinary) is applied to stir up sexual
intercourse [aphrodisiac]. The leaves, pounded into small 
pieces with honey and applied, clean ulcers that spread.
The garden pastinaca is fitter to be eaten, and is good for
the same purposes, working more weakly. It is also called
cerascomen; the Romans call it carota, some pastinaca
rustica, the Egyptians, babiburu, and the Africans sicham.

SUGGESTED: Seseli massiliense [Fuchs],
 Gingidium umbella oblonga [Bauhin], Daucus visagna
[Linnaeus], Ammi visagna [in Sprague], Daucus visagna 
— Pick-tooth, Tooth Pick 
Seseli Massiliense has leaves similar to marathrum [3-81]
yet thicker, and it has a stalk more full of branches. It
has a tuft similar to dill, in which is a seed — somewhat
long, angular, and quickly sharp if eaten. The root is long
with a sweet scent. The seed and root are warming: taken
as a drink they cure slow painful urination and
orthopnoea [form of asthma]. They are good for urinary
constriction and epilepsy, induce the menstrual flow, are
abortifacient, and are effective for all disorders within.
They cure old coughs, and taken as a drink with wine the
seed helps digestion and dissolves griping. It is also good
for cooling [sudden] fevers, and is taken as a drink with
pepper and wine for chills in childbirth. It is given to
goats and other cattle as a drink for hastening delivery. It
is also called sphagnon.
3-61. SESELI AITHIOPIKON
SUGGESTED: Dauci alterum genus, Seseli aethiopicum [Fuchs],
Libanotis latifolia altera [Bauhin], Laserpitium latifolium
[Linnaeus] — Broad-leaved Laserwort [Loudon]
Ethiopian seselis has leaves similar to cissus [2-210] yet
smaller and somewhat long, similar to those of
periclymenom. It is a large shrub with branches of about
two feet, on which are stems eighteen inches long. The
little heads are like dill; the seeds black, thick like wheat,
yet sharper and more fragrant than the Massaleotican
[3-60], and very sweet. It produces similar effects. The
Egyptians call it cyonophricen.

[Fuchs], Peucedanum cervaria [in Sprague],
 Daucus montanus apii [Bauhin], Athamanta cervaria [Linnaeus]
— Hog Fennel, Wild Celery
That which grows in Peloponnesus has leaves similar
to hemlock but broader and thicker, and a stalk
bigger than the Massiliense [3-60], similar to a ferula. On
the top of this is a broad tuft, in which is a broader seed
with a sweet scent and more fleshy. It has the same
strength [as those above]. It grows in rough, moist and
hilly places. It also grows in Ida.
3-63. TORDULION
SUGGESTED: Daucus creticus, Tordylon, Seseli creticum [Fuchs],
Athemanta meum [Linnaeus], Aethusa meum,

formerly included in genus Seseli
Tordylium grows on the hill Amanus in Cilicia. It is a
little herb full of shoots, with a little round double
seed similar to little shields, somewhat sharp and
aromatic. It is taken in a drink for painful urination, and
to expel the menstrual flow. The juice from the stalk and
seed (while yet green) taken as a drink for ten days with
as much as thirty grains of passum [raisin wine], makes
any kidney disease sound. The root is licked in with
honey to draw up matter that stops the chest. It is also
called tordylum, while others call it creticum.

3-64. SISON
SUGGESTED: Sison amomum, Sium amomum, Sium aromaticum
— Hedge Sison, Bastard Stone Parsley 
Sison is a little seed similar to apium [3-77] that grows in
Syria — somewhat long, black, with an acrid taste. It
is taken in a drink for the spleen, painful urination, and
retention of the menstrual flow. The inhabitants use it for
a sauce, eating it with cucurbita [2-164] boiled with
vinegar. It has (as it were) many little grains on the tops. 
3-65. ANISON
SUGGESTED: Anisum herbariis [Bauhin], Pimpinella anisum
[Linnaeus], Anisum vulgare, Tragium anisum — Anise, 
Sweet Cumin, Aniseed Plant 
Anisum is generally warming, drying, pain-easing,
dissolving, urinary, dispersing, and it makes the
breath sweet. Taken in a drink it takes away thirst caused
by dropsy. It is also good for removing the poison of
venomous creatures, and gaseousness. It stops
discharges of the intestines and white excessive
discharges, draws down milk, and incites sexual union
[aphrodisiac]. Inhaled by the nostrils it quietens
headaches, and pounded into small pieces and dropped
in the ears with rosaceum [1-53], it heals cracks in them.
The best is new, full, not branny and strongly scented.
The Cretian claims the first place, and the second is the
Egyptian. It is also called sion, and the Romans call it
anisum.
3-66. KAROS
SUGGESTED: Caros, Careum [Fuchs], Carum carvi [Linnaeus],
Apium carvi, Bunium carum — Caraway
Carum is a well-known little seed. It is urinary,
warming, good for the stomach, pleasant to the
mouth and digestive. It is mixed usefully in antidotes and 
oxypota [oxymel — vinegar and honey drink]. It has much 
the same nature as anisum [3-65]. The boiled root is edible
as a vegetable (like parsnip).

SUGGESTED: Anethum hortense [Bauhin]
Anethum graveolens [Linnaeus], Peucedanum graveolens,
 Selinum athenum, Pastinaca athenum — Dill 
Anethum is eaten as a vegetable. A decoction of the
dried filaments and the seed (taken as a drink)
draws down milk, soothes griping and gaseousness, and
stops both the intestines and the vomit that floats on top
of the stomach; it makes urine pass, it stops hiccups, and
taken too often as a drink it both dulls the sight and
extinguishes conception [ abortifacient]. A decoction is
good as a bath for women troubled with womb disorders. 
The seed (burnt and sprinkled on) takes away venereal
warts. It is also called polgidos or anicetum; the Magi call it
genitura cynocephali ; similarly, crines cynocephali,  or
genitura Mercurij . The Egyptians call it arachu, the
Romans, anethum, the Africans, sicciria, and the Dacians,
poltum. 
3-68. KUMINON AGRION
SUGGESTED: Cuminum cyminum, Cuminum odoratum 
— Cumin
Cumin is cultivated. It has a good taste, especially the
Ethiopian which Hippocrates called the kingly, next
the Egyptian, and then the rest. It grows in Galatia, Asia,
Cilicia, the region of Tarentum and many other places. It
is hot, astringent, and drying. It is good boiled with oil
and given as a suppository (or applied with barley meal)
for griping and gaseousness. It is also given with posca
[hot drinks] for orthopnoea [ difficult breathing], and
with wine to those bitten by venomous creatures.
Applied with raisins and bean flour (or waxy ointments)
it helps inflammation from stones [ urinary, kidney].
Pounded into small pieces with vinegar it is applied to
stop women’s excessive discharges [menstrual flow] and
bleeding from the nostrils. It also changes the skin to a
paler colour either taken in a drink or smeared on. 
 443
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

3-69. KUMINON EMERON
SUGGESTED: Lagoëcia cuminoides — Common Wild Cumin 
Cuminum sylvestre grows in Lycia, Galatia in Asia, and
Carthage in Spain. These are the most effective. It is
a little shrub with a thin stalk twenty centimetres long, on 
which are four or five little leaves (as it were) sawn-
around with incisions (like gingidium [2-167]). It has five
or six little round, soft heads on the top, in which is the
husky seed, sharper to the taste than the cultivated. It
grows in hilly places. The seed is taken in a drink with
water for griping and gaseousness. With vinegar it
soothes hiccups. It is taken with wine for the poison of
venomous creatures and moisture of the stomach.
Chewed and applied with honey and grapes it takes
away bruises. Applied with the same [things] it cures
inflammation from stones [urinary, kidney]. There is also
another kind of wild cumin similar to the cultivated. Out
of every flower it sends out little horns lifted up in which
is the seed (similar to melanthium [3-93]). Taken in a drink
this is an excellent remedy for those bitten by snakes. It
helps those troubled with slow painful urination and
stones [urinary, kidney], and those who urinate drops of
blood. Afterwards let them drink boiled apium [3-77]
seeds. The Romans call it cuminum agreste, and some call it 
cuminum silvaticum. 
3-70. AMMI
SUGGESTED: Ammi majus [Bauhin, Linnaeus] 
— Bishop’s Weed, Amee see 3-58
[other usage] Aegopodium podagraria — Ammi [1551],
 Herb Gerard, Bishop’s Weed, Goutweed, Ground Elder
Ammi is a well-known little seed, smaller than cumin,
and similar to origanum in the taste. Choose seed
that is pure and not branny. This is warming, acrid and
drying. It is good (taken in a drink with wine) for griping,
difficult painful urination, and those bitten by venomous
creatures. It induces the menstrual flow. It is mixed with
corrosive medicines made of dried beetles [2-65] to resist
the difficult painful urination that follows. Applied with
honey it takes away bruises around the eyes. Taken

called Aethiopicum, or regium cuminum , but some have
said that the Ethiopian cumin has one nature and the
ammi another. 
3-71. KORIANNON 
SUGGESTED: Coriandrum [Fuchs], Coriandrum majus [Bauhin]
 Coriandrum sativum — Coriander
POSSIBLE ALLERGIC REACTIONS
Corion or coriannum is well known. It is able to cool. As
a result (applied with bread or polenta) it heals
erysipela [streptococcal skin infection] and creeping
ulcers. With honey and raisins it cures epinyctis [pustules
which appear only at night], inflammation from stones
[urinary, kidney], and carbuncles [infected boils]
[malignant skin tumours]. With bruised beans it dissolves 
scrofulous tumours [ goitres] and the inflammation of
bones. A little of the seed (taken as a drink with passum
[raisin wine]) expels worms and promotes the creation of
seed [ sperm]. If too much is taken it disturbs the
understanding dangerously, as a result men ought to
avoid the excessive and frequent use of it. The juice
rubbed on with cerussa [white lead ore] or litharge
[monoxide of lead], vinegar and rosaceum [1-53] mends
burning inflammation on the outside of the skin. The
Egyptians call it ochion, and the Africans, goid.
3-72. IERAKION MEGA 
SUGGESTED: Hieracium maius, Sonchites [Fuchs],
Sonchus arvensis [Linnaeus] — Corn Sowthistle 
[other usage] Hieracium sylvaticum, Hieracium murorum
— Wood Hawkweed, Wall Hawkweed
The great  hieracium  produces a rough stalk —
somewhat red, prickly, hollow. It has thinly-jagged
leaves at distances, similar in circumference to sonchus
[2-159]; and yellowish flowers in somewhat long little
heads. It is cooling, indifferent, and gently astringent. As
 447
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK
Hieracium majus

a result it is good applied on a burning stomach, and for
inflammation. The juice is sipped to soothe pangs of
hunger in the stomach. The herb (with the root) is
applied to help one bitten by a scorpion. It is also called
sonchiten; the Romans call itlampuca, and the Africans,
sithileas.
3-73. IERAKION MIKRON
SUGGESTED: Hieraceum minus [Fuchs], Crepis tectorum
[Linnaeus] — Hawksbeard [Mabberley]
[other usage] Hieracium pilosella — Mouse-ear Hawkweed 
The little hieracium also has jagged leaves at distances.
It sends out tender little green stalks on which are
yellow flowers in a circle. It has the same uses as that
previously spoken of [3-72]. Some call this sonchiten,
others, entimon agrion, the Romans,  intubus agrestis, and
the Africans, sithilesade. 
3-74. SELINON AGRION, SELINON
KEPAION
SUGGESTED: Apium, Apium hortense [Fuchs], Eleoselinum,

 Apium celleri, Celeri graveolens — Marsh Celery,
 Wild Celery, Celery, Marsh Parsley, Smallage 
 
[other usage] Selinum carvifola — Milk Parsley 
The herb garden selinum applied with bread or floured 
polenta is good for the same things as coriander (as
well as for inflammation of the eyes). It soothes burning
in the stomach, slacks breasts swollen with clotted milk,
and eaten boiled or raw it causes an urge to urinate. A
decoction of it with the roots (taken as a drink) resists
poisonous medicines [ antidote] by causing vomiting. It
stops discharges of the bowels. The seed is more urinary,
also helping those bitten by poisonous beasts and those
who have taken a drink of white lead. It also breaks
winds. It is mixed effectively with pain-easing medicines, 
antidotes and cough medicines.

Oreoselinon has a single stalk twenty centimetres high 
from a slender root. Around it are little branches
with little heads (similar to hemlock yet a great deal more
slender) on which is the seed — somewhat long, sharp,
thin, with a sweet smell, similar to cumin. It grows in
rocky mountainous places. Taken as a drink in wine both
the seed and root are urinary, and they also expel the
menstrual flow. It is mixed with antidotes, diuretics, and
heating medicines. We must not be deceived thinking
oreoselinon is that which grows on rocks, for petroselinum
is different. It is also called petroselinum sylvestre ; the
Romans call it apium montanum , and the Egyptians,
anonim.

 Athamanta oreoselinum — Mountain Parsley 
Apium (also called petroselinum) grows in steep places
in Macedonia. It has seed similar to ammi visagna but
 451

with a sweeter, sharp, aromatic scent. It is diuretic and
expels the menstrual flow. It is good (taken in a drink) for
gaseousness, griping of the stomach, and colus [colic], as
well as pain in the sides, kidneys, and bladder. It is also
mixed with urinary antidotes. 
3-78. IPPOSELINON

Hipposelinon is different to that which is properly
called smyrnium (as we will immediately declare). It
is bigger and paler than the garden selinum; the stalk
hollow, high, tender (as it were) with lines; the leaves
broader, inclining to purple; over which are filaments
like libanotis [3-87, 3-89]. It is full of flowers standing
together in clusters before it has fully opened. The seed is
black, somewhat long, solid, sharp, aromatic. The root is
sweet in scent, white, pleasing to the taste, and not thick.
It grows in shady places and near marshes. It is used as a
vegetable like selinum [3-74, 3-75]. The root is eaten boiled
or raw, and the leaves and stalks are eaten boiled. They
are prepared either by themselves or with fish, and
preserved raw in brine. Taken as a drink in honeyed wine 
the seed is able to expel the menstrual flow. Taken as a
drink or rubbed on it heats those who are chilled. It helps
slow painful urination, and the root does the same. It is
also called grielon, others call it agrioselinon, or smyrnium,
and the Romans call it olusatrum.

Smyrnium (which they call petroselinum in Cilicia)
grows plentifully on the hill called Amanus. This has
a stalk similar to selinum [3-74, 3-75] with many sprigs, but 
the leaves are broader towards the ground. They wind
around beneath, somewhat thick, strong and sweet
smelling, with sharpness, and a medicinal scent, and
inclining to a faint yellow in colour. There is a tuft on the
stalk similar to that of dill [3-67]. The round seed is similar 
to that of colewort  [2-146] — black; sharp, like myrrh
[1-77, 1-73, 4-116] to the taste, making one for one. The
root is sharp, fragrant, tender, full of juice, biting the top
of the throat, with the bark black on the outside, but pale
within or a faint white. It grows in dry rocky or hilly
places and untilled corners. The root, herb and seed are
warming. The leaves are eaten preserved in brine like
vegetables, and they stop discharges of the bowels. The
root (taken in a drink) helps those bitten by snakes; it also
soothes coughs and orthopnoea [ difficult breathing,
asthma], and heals difficult painful urination. Applied, it
dissolves recent oedema, inflammations and hard lumps, 
and it brings wounds to a scar. Boiled and applied as a
pessary it causes abortion. The seed is good for the
kidneys, spleen, and bladder. Taken as a drink with wine
it expels the menstrual flow and afterbirth, and is good
for sciatica. It soothes gaseousness in the stomach, and
causes sweat and belching. It is especially taken in a drink 
for dropsy, and recurrent fevers.

Elaphoboscum has a knotty stalk similar to libanotis or to
marathrum [3-81]. The leaves are two fingers-breadth, 
very long like terminthos [1-91], broken around in a sharp
way. The stalk has very many little sprigs, with pale
yellow tufts similar to dill flowers [3-67], and the seed is
also similar to dill. The root is about the length of three
fingers, the thickness of a finger, white, sweet and edible.
The new stalks are eaten [as vegetables] like other herbs.
They say that deer having fed on this very herb thereby
resist the bites of snakes, as a result the seed is given with
wine to those bitten by snakes. 
Some call it elaphicum, others  nephrium, ophigenium,
ophioctonon, herpyxe or lyme; the Romans call it cervi
ocellum, the Egyptians chemis, and the Africans, ascacau.

Marathrum (the herb itself), eaten, is able to draw
down milk [in breastfeeding], as does the seed
taken in a drink or boiled together with barley water. A
decoction of the fronds (taken as a drink) is good for
inflamed kidneys and disorders of the bladder as it is
diuretic. Taken as a drink with wine it is suitable for those
bitten by snakes. Taken as a drink with cold water it
expels the menstrual flow, and lessens the burning heat
of fevers and nausea of the stomach. The roots (pounded
into small pieces and applied with honey) heal dog bites.
Juice from the bruised stalks and leaves (dried in the sun)
is a useful preparation for eye medicines, such as for
restoration of the sight. The green seed together with the

leaves and branches is juiced for the same purposes, as
well as the root when the new stems emerge. In Iberia
towards the west it sends out a liquid similar to gum. The
inhabitants cut it down around the middle of the stalk
during its flowering and lay it by the fire so that (as it
were) in a sweat near the warmth it may exude the gum,
and this is more effective than the juice for eye medicines.
It is also called elaphicum, nephrium, ophigenium,

 Hippomaratrum siculus — Hairy Hippomarathrum  
Hippomarathrum is the tall wild marathrum. It bears
seed similar to cachryi [3-88]. The root underneath
has a sweet scent, and taken in a drink cures slow painful
urination. Applied, it expels the menstrual flow. A
decoction of the seed and root (taken as a drink) stops
discharges of the bowels, helps those bitten by poisonous
beasts, breaks stones [ urinary, kidney], and cleans
jaundice. A decoction of the leaves (taken as a drink)
brings out milk [breastfeeding], and cleans women after
childbirth. There is another herb called hippomarathrum
that has small, slender, somewhat long leaves and the
round seed is similar to that of coriander, sharp, with a
sweet scent, heating. The properties of it are similar to
those above, working more weakly. It is also called
marathrum sylvestre ; the Egyptians call it  sampsos, the
Magi, thymarnolion, Romans, faeniculum erraticum, some,
faeniculos, others, cuinos, or  meum, and the Gauls,
sistrameor.

Daucus (which is also called dircaeum) from Crete has
leaves similar to marathrum [3-81] yet smaller and
more slender, a stalk twenty centimetres long, and a tuft
similar to coriander. The flowers are white, and in these is 
the seed which is sharp, white, rough and sweet smelling
when chewed. The root is about the thickness of a finger,
twenty centimetres in length. It grows in rocky sunny
places. There is another kind similar to wild selinum —
sharp, sweet smelling and hot to one who tastes it, but
that from Crete is the best. The third kind has leaves
similar to coriander, with white flowers, but a head and
seed similar to dill [3-67]. On the head is a tuft similar to
pastinaca [3-59], full of long seed, sharp like cumin. A
decoction of the seed of any of them (taken as a drink) is
warming. It expels the menstrual flow, is an abortifacient, 
induces the flow of urine, and frees one from griping,
relieving old coughs. A decoction (taken as a drink with
wine) helps those bitten by harvest spiders. Applied, it
dissolves oedema. Only the seed of all the others is
useful, but of the Cretan kind the root is also useful. This
is taken as a drink with wine (especially) against harm
from poisonous beasts.

they are named). The flower is similar to the white violet,
with a purple colour. The seed in the pods resembles
milium [3-158], and (taken as a drink in wine) helps those
bitten by scorpions like nothing else can. They also say

that scorpions grow faint and become inactive and numb
when the herb is applied to them, and when it is taken
away they are restored to their former state. It grows in
rough sunny places. It is also called diachysis, diachytos,
paralysis, camaros, hyacinthus, delphinias, nerion, nereadium,
sosacros, or cronios; the Romans call it buccinus minor.
3-85. DELPHINION ETERON
SUGGESTED: Delphinium elatum
250 species in genus — poisonous
The other delphinium is similar to that above, yet is
much more slender in the leaves and branches. It has
the same properties as that previously mentioned, but it
is not altogether as effective. It is also called hyacinthum;
the Romans call it bucinus.
3-86. PURETHRON

[Linnaeus],  Anacyclus pyrethrum [in Sprague]
— Pellitory of Spain, Alexander’s Foot 
[other usage] Pyrethrum tanacetum — Tansy, Cost, Costmary 
 Pyrethrum balsamita — Pyrethrum, Feverfew 
Pyrethrum is a herb which sends out a stalk and leaves
like wild daucus [3-83] and marathrum [3-81], and a
tuft like dill [3-67]. The root is long, about the thickness of
the big finger, similar to hair curled round, extremely
burning and hot to one who tastes it. It draws out
phlegm; as a result boiled with vinegar and used as a
mouthwash it helps toothache. Chewed, it expels
phlegm; and rubbed on with oil it produces sweats, is
helpful for long-lasting chills, and is excellent for chilled
or paralytic parts of the body. It is also called dorycnion,
pyrinon, pyroton, pyrothron, or arnopurites; the Magi call it
purites, and the Romans, salivaris.

 Libanotis cretensis, Athamanta cretensis, Athamanta annua 
—  Cretan Carrot, Candy Carrot 
 Hippomaratrum libanotis, Cachrys libanotis, Cachola
— Rosemary Frankincense 
see 3-88, 3-89
Libanotis has two types — one of which bears fruit 
called zea by some (or campsanema), the seed of which
is called cachris [see cachry below]. It has leaves similar to
marathrum [3-81] but thicker and broader, lying like a
wheel on the ground, smelling sweet. The stalk is a foot
and more [in length] with many wings, and on the top is
a tuft in which is a lot of white seed shaped like a
vertebra, round, with corners, sharp smelling, similar to
rosin, and chewed is burning to the taste. The root is
white, very large, and smells of frankincense. 
The second kind is similar in everything to the first,
but it bears a broad black seed like sphondylium [3-90],
sweet-smelling, not burning. The root is black on the
outer part, but when broken white. That which is called
infertile (being similar to that mentioned before) sends
out neither stalk nor flower nor seed. It grows in rough,
rocky places. The herb of all of them in general (pounded
and applied) stops haemorrhoids, lessens inflammations
(such as in the perineum) and venereal warts, and
dissolves suppurations that are dissolved with difficulty.
With honey the dry roots clean ulcers, cure griping, and
are good for those bitten by venomous creatures. A
decoction (taken as a drink with wine) expels the
menstrua [ menstrual flow] and urine, and applied it
dissolves old oedemas. Juice from the root and herb
(mixed with honey and rubbed on) restores the sight. A
decoction of the seed (taken as a drink) does the same.
Given with pepper and wine it helps epilepsy, old
disorders in the chest, and jaundice. Rubbed on with oil it 
causes sweat. Pounded into small pieces and applied
with lolium meal [2-116, 4-140] and vinegar, it is good for
hernia, convulsions, and gout in the feet. Mixed with the
sharpest vinegar it cleans vitiligines [form of leprosy]; and

for abscesses we ought to use the kind that bears no
cachrys [seed], for that is sharp and harsh to the throat. 
Theophrastus speaks of a libanotis growing with erica,
with leaves similar to wild lettuce, which is bitter, and has 
a short root, but the leaves are paler and sharper than
those of lettuce. A decoction of this (taken as a drink)
purges upward and downward.

 Cachrys panacifolia — Parsnip-leaved Cachrys 
 Crithmum maritimum, Cachrys maritimum — Samphire,

Cachry is warming and extraordinarily drying, as a
result it is good mixed with sebaceous treatments,
and it is sprinkled on the head and wiped off after three
days for rheumatic eyes. 
3-89. LIBANOTIS 
SUGGESTED: Libanotis coronaria, Rosmarinus [Fuchs],
 Rosmarinus officinalis [Linnaeus] — Common Rosemary,

Libanotis the Romans call rosmarinus and those who
plait wreaths for the head use it. The shoots are
slender, around which are small leaves — thick,
somewhat long, thin, white on the inside, but green on
the outside, with a strong scent. It is warming and cures
jaundice. It is boiled in water and given to drink before
exercises, and then he who exercises bathes and is
drenched with wine. It is also mixed with remedies for
the removal of fatigue, and in gleucinum [1-67] ointments.

SUGGESTED: Acanthus germanica [Fuchs], 
Sphondylium vulgare hirsutum [Bauhin],
 Heracleum sphondylium [Linnaeus], Sphondylium branca ursina
— Meadow Parsnip, Cow Parsnip, Hogweed 
 JUICE CAUSES BLISTERS AND PERMANENT PURPLE PIGMENTATION
Sphondylium has leaves somewhat similar to platanus
[1-107] as well as to those of panax [3-55]. The stalks
are a foot high (or rather more) similar to marathrum
[3-81]. The seed on the top is double, similar to seselis, but
broader, paler, and huskier, with a strong scent. The
flowers are white, and the root is white like raphanus
[2-137]. It grows in moist, marshy countries. The seed of
this (taken in a drink) purges phlegmy stuff through the
bowels. Taken in a drink it cures the liver, jaundice,
asthma, epilepsy and constriction of the womb. Inhaled,
it revives those who fall in a faint. If the head is moistened 
with it (with oil), it is good for fever of the brain, lethargy,
and headaches. Applied with rue [3-52] it restrains herpes
[viral skin infection]. The root is given to the jaundiced
and liverish. Shaved and inserted it eliminates the
hardness of fistulas [ ulcers]. The fresh juice from the
flower is good for ulcerated and purulent ears. It is also
preserved, placed in the sun like other juices. It is also
called arangem, phalangium, asterium, nisyris, sphondulis,
choradanon, or oenanthe; the Romans call it herba rotularis,
the Egyptians, apsapher, and the Magi, osiris. 
3-91. NARTHEX
SUGGESTED: Ferula foetida, Ferula puberula,
 Narthex asafoeteda — Asafoetida, Assafoetida 
The pith of narthex (which the Romans call ferula)
taken in a drink whilst it is green helps bloodspitting
and stomach complaints. It is given with wine to those
bitten by snakes, and put in as a tent [a curved slice
inserted] it stops flows of blood from the nostrils. Taken
in a drink the seed helps those troubled with griping.
Rubbed on with oil it encourages sweating. The stalks
cause headaches if eaten. They are also preserved in
brine. The ferula frequently brings forth a stalk fifty

yet much thicker and bigger, from which (cut in near to
the root) comes the sagapenum [see 3-95] (gum).
3-92. PEUKEDANON
SUGGESTED: Peucedanum germanicum [Bauhin]
 Peucedanum officinale [Linnaeus], Selinum officinale,
 Selinum peucedanum — Hog’s Fennel, Sulphur Weed 
see 3-80
Peucedanum sends out a thin, slender stalk similar to
marathrum [3-81]. It has thick hairs in abundance
around the root. The flower is yellow; the root black, with 
a strong scent, very full of liquid. It grows on shady hills.
The liquid is taken as follows: the root whilst still tender is 
cut with a knife, and that which flows from it is presently
placed in the shade (for under direct sunlight it is
coloured immediately). Gathering it causes headaches
and brings on vertigo if you do not rub your nostrils
beforehand with rosaceum [1-53], and also wet your head
beforehand with it. The root becomes useless having lost
its liquid. The stalks and the root have their liquid
removed like mandrake and are juiced, but this liquid
does not work as well and quickly becomes useless.
Sometimes a fluid similar to frankincense is found,
already congealed, sticking to the stalks and to the roots.
The juice made in Sardinia and Samothracia is the best,
with a strong scent, yellowish, warming to the taste. It is
good rubbed on with vinegar and rosaceum [1-53] for
lethargy, mental illness, vertigo, and epilepsy, for those
who have suffered for a long time with headaches, for the 
paralytic, sciatica, and rubbed on with oil and vinegar for
the convulsed. The scent is good in general for disorders
of the strength. It should be inhaled for womb
constriction, revives those who fall in a faint, and drives
away snakes. It is good for earache dropped in with of oil
of roses, and put into cavities for toothache. It is good
(taken with an egg) for coughs. It is effective for hard
breathing, griping and windy afflictions. It gently
soothes the intestines, lessens the spleen, and
wonderfully helps hard labour in childbirth. A decoction
(taken as a drink) is effective for disorders and matters
related to the bladder and kidneys. It removes blockages
 471
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

of the womb. The root is effective for the same purposes,
working less effectively. A decoction of this (pounded
into small pieces) is taken as a drink. Dried, it cleans foul
ulcers, removes scales from bones, and heals old ulcers. It
is mixed with stiff ointments and warm compresses.
Choose roots that are new, uneaten [by worms], sound,
full of scent. The liquid is dissolved in pills with bitter
almonds, rue, and warm bread or dill [3-67]. It is also
called agrion, or agriophyllon; the Magi call it bonus daemon,
some, pinasgelum, and the Romans, stataria.

SUGGESTED: Melanthium hortense primum, 
Schwartz Kommich [Fuchs], Nigella sativa [Linnaeus]
 — Common Fennel Flower, Black Cumin
Melanthium alterum Damascenum vocatum, 
Nigella hortensis altera [Fuchs], Nigella angustifolia [Bauhin],

Melanthium sylvestre, Cuminum sylvestre alterum [Fuchs],
Nigella arvensis [Linnaeus]
POISONOUS
Melanthium is a little shrub with slender shoots two
feet in length or more. It has small leaves similar to
senecio [ragwort] but much more slender, and a small little 
head on the top like poppy, somewhat long, with side
partitions in which are seed — black, sharp, sweet
smelling, used sprinkled on loaves. It is good applied to
the forehead for those troubled with headaches. It is
poured into the nostrils (after it is pounded into small
pieces with irinum [1-66]) for those who begin to have
liquids dripping from their eyes. Applied with vinegar it
takes away freckles, leprosy, old oedema, and hard
lumps. Applied with old wine it takes away corns that are 
first incised or cut around. It is good for toothache, the
mouth washed with it (boiled with vinegar and taeda
[pitch pine]). The nail [fingernail for application]
smeared with it with water, it expels roundworms.
Pounded into small pieces, bound up in a loincloth and
inhaled, it helps those troubled with mucus. Drunk for
several days it draws out the menstrual flow, urine and

milk [breastfeeding]. A decoction (taken as a drink with
wine) eases difficult breathing. A teaspoonful (taken as a
drink with water) helps those bitten by harvest spiders.
Inhaled, it drives away snakes. They say that it kills if a lot 
is taken (in a drink). Some also call this mecon agria melana; 
the Romans call it papaver niger.
3-94. SILPHION
SUGGESTED: Laserpitium germanicum, Osteritium [Fuchs],
Imperatoria major [Bauhin], Imperatoria ostruthium [Linnaeus],
Peucedanum ostruthium [in Sprague] — Masterwort, 
Broad-leaved Hog’s Fennel 
There is evidence that the silphium of the ancients was harvested to extinction. 
[other usage] Silphium laciniatum — Compass Plant
Silphium grows in places around Syria, Armenia,
Media and Libya. The stalk, called maspetum, is very
like ferula [3-95], but with leaves similar to apium [3-77]
and a broad seed. 
The root is warming, hard to digest, inflative, and
hurts the bladder. It cures scrofulous tumours [glandular
swelling, goitres] and tuberculae [nodules] used in a wax
ointment, or smeared on bruises with oil. With a wax
ointment of irinum [1-66] and cyprinum [1-65] it is suitable
for use in sciatica. Boiled in a pomegranate skin with
vinegar and applied, it takes away abnormal growths
around the perineum. A decoction (taken as a drink) is an
antitoxin for deadly medicines. It tastes good mixed with
sauces and salt. The liquid is gathered from the roots and
stalks that are cut. Of this the best is somewhat red and
transparent (emulating myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116]), and
predominant in its smell, neither scented like leek nor
unpleasant to taste, and easily changing into a white
colour. Although you taste ever so little of the Cyrenian, it 
causes dullness over your body, and it is very gentle to
smell, so that if you taste it your mouth breathes but a
little of it. The Median and Syrian are weaker in strength
and they have a more poisonous smell. All the juice is
adulterated before it is dry, sagapenum [3-95] or bean meal 
being mixed with it, which you shall discern by the taste,
smell, sight and feel. Some have called the stalk sylphium,
the root magudarim, and the leaves maspeta. The juice is
 475
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

the most effective, then the leaves, and then the stalk.  It is 
inflative and sharp, curing alopecia [baldness] by rubbing
it with wine, pepper and vinegar.
 It causes quickness of sight, and smeared on with
honey disperses the dripping of fluids [in the eyes] as
they begin. For toothache it is put into cavities, or put into 
a linen cloth with frankincense it is wrapped around the
tooth, or the mouth is washed with it (with hyssop [3-30]
and figs boiled with posca [hot drinks]). It is good applied
to the wounds of those bitten by dogs; and rubbed on or
taken as a drink for injuries from all poisonous beasts and 
poisoned arrows. It is rubbed on diluted in oil for those
touched by scorpions. It is poured into gangrene that is
first incised or cut. For carbuncles [infected boils,
malignant skin tumours] it is used with rue, saltpetre
[potassium nitrate] and honey, or by itself. It takes away
corns and fleshy hardnesses that are first cut in all
around. It is first kneaded together with wax ointment (or 
the inside of dry figs and vinegar) to cure recent lichen
[skin disease]. For carcomata [carcinomata — now cancer — 
old use: disease of the cornea] and polyps [growths from
mucus membrane] it is rubbed on for several days with
cobblers ink or aerugo [verdigris — brass oxide], but you
must pull off protuberances with a pair of pliers. It helps
long-lasting difficulties of the lungs. Diluted in water and 
sipped, it immediately clears a voice that is suddenly
hoarse. 
Smeared on with honey it represses inflammation of
the uvula. With honey and water it is an effective gargle
for synanchic [ abscessed] throats. Taken with meat it
makes skin better coloured, and it is good for coughs
given with a raw egg, and to be sipped for pleurisy. With
dry figs it is effective for jaundice and dropsy. A
decoction (taken as a drink) with pepper, frankincense
and wine dissolves chills. Having made ten grains of it
into a pill give it to swallow to those with tetanus, and to
the opisthotonic [form of tetanus]. Gargled with vinegar
it casts off horseleeches that stick to the throat. It is good
for those whose milk curdles within [breastfeeding], and
taken with vinegar and honey helps epilepsy. A
decoction (taken as a drink with pepper and myrrh [1-77,
1-73, 4-116]) induces the menstrual flow. Taken with
raisins it helps the coeliac [ intestinal complaints]. A
decoction (taken as a drink with lye [alkaline salts in
water]) helps sudden convulsions and hernia. It is

dissolved in pills with bitter almonds, rue [3-52, 3-53,

in the same way, but is considerably less effective. It is
eaten with vinegar and honey and is good for the
arteries, and (especially) for cut-off voices [ laryngitis].
They eat it [as a salad] with lettuce instead of eruca. There
is said to be another magudaris [gift of the wise man] that
grows in Libya, the root of which is similar to silphium but
somewhat less thick — sharp, with a loose substance and
without juice. It does the same things as silphium. 
3-95. SAGAPENON 
SUGGESTED: Ferula persica — Ferula, Giant Fennel 
 produces sagapenum gum resin
Sagapenum is the liquid of the ferulacean herb growing
in Media. The best is transparent, a yellow colour
outside but white inside, smelling in-between the juice of
silphium [3-94] and galbanum, and sharp to the taste. It is
good for pains, and is an abortifacient. Taken with wine it 
also heals those bitten by venomous creatures. Inhaled
with vinegar it raises up those with a strangled
[congested, blocked] womb. It cleans scars in the eyes,
dullness of sight, things that darken the pupils, and
dripping fluids. It is dissolved as a liquid with rue, water,
bitter almonds and honey, or warm bread.
3-96. EUPHORBION
SUGGESTED: Euphorbia amygdaloides — Wood Spurge
 Euphorbia officinarum — Poisonous Gum Thistle 
see tithymal 4-165 a-f, also 4-170
Euphorbium is a tree-like ferula in Libya that grows on
Tmolus, a hill near Mauretania. It is full of very sharp
liquid. The men there are afraid of it because of its
extraordinary heat, and gather it as follows. Binding
around the tree washed sheep stomachs and standing a
distance away, they pierce the stalk with long tools; and
presently a quantity of liquid flows out (like out of some
jar) into the bellies. When pierced like this it also spills on
the ground. There are two kinds of this liquid: one
 479
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

transparent like sarcocolla [3-99] (similar to ervum [2-129,
2-131]), but the other that is gathered in the bellies has a
glassy look and is compact. It is adulterated with sarcocolla
and glue mixed together. Choose that which is
transparent and sharp, but that which is tasted is very
hard to test because the tongue having been once bitten
the burning remains for a long time, so that whatever is
brought seems to be euphorbium. The first discovery of it
was when Juba was king of Libya. The juice rubbed on
has the ability to dissolve liquids. A decoction (taken as a
drink) burns for a whole day; as a result it is mixed with
honey and collyriums [1642 CE — eye salve; 1748 CE —
suppository] depending on the sharpness. It is mixed
with aromatic liquid medicines and is good (taken as a
drink) for sore hips. It removes scales from bones the
same day, but it is necessary for those who use it to secure 
the flesh lying around the bones with linen cloths or stiff
ointments. Some claim that no hurt will fall on those
bitten by snakes if (having cut the skin of the head even to 
the bone) you pour in this resin (pounded into small
pieces) and sew up the wound.
3-97. CHALBANE 
SUGGESTED: Ferula galbaniflua — Galbanum Plant 
used in incense
Galbanum is the resin of the ferula growing in Syria. It
is also called metopium [1-71]. The best is similar to
frankincense, clotted, pure, fat, not woody, with
something like seeds of ferula mixed, with a strong scent,
neither too moist nor too dry. They adulterate it by
mixing it with rosin, bruised beans and ammoniacum
[3-98]. It is warming, burning, attractive and dispersing.
Either applied or inhaled it expels the menstrual flow and 
is an abortifacient. Smeared on with vinegar and
saltpetre [potassium nitrate] it takes away freckles. It is
also swallowed down for old coughs, hard breathing,
asthma, hernia, and convulsions. A decoction (taken as a
drink) with vinegar and myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116] resists
poison. Taken like this it casts out a dead embryo. It is
applied for pains in the side, and boils or inflammatory
tumours. Inhaled, it raises up the epileptic, and helps
womb congestion and those with vertigo. Inhaled, it

drives away poisonous beasts, and keeps those rubbed
with it unbitten. Applied all over [the body] with
sphondylium [3-90] and oil it kills snakes. Smeared on the
tooth or put into a cavity it soothes toothaches, and it
seems to be good for frequent painful urination. It is
dissolved in pills with bitter almonds and water (or rue,
or honey and water, or warm bread, or else with
meconium [4-65], or burned brass, or liquid myrica gale). If
you want to purify it put it into warm water. When
melted the filth from it will swim on top and you can
separate it as follows. Tie the galbanum in a clean thin
linen cloth, hang it in a brass pot or ceramic jar so that the
bundle does not touch the bottom of the jar. Plug it closed 
and pour boiling water over it, for this way the best will
be melted (as through a strainer) but the woody stuff will
remain in the linen cloth. 
3-98. AMMONIAKON
SUGGESTED: Dorema ammoniacum, Dorema aurium, 
Diserneston gummiferum, Peucedanum ammoniacum 
— Gum Ammoniacum Plant, Gum of Ammon, Dorema 
Ammoniacum is the herb from which ammoniacan
incense is gathered. It is the liquid of a ferula that
grows in Libya near Cyrene. The whole shrub (together
with the root) is called agasyllis. The best has a good
colour, is not woody, without stones, similar to
frankincense in little clots, clear and thick, without filth,
similar to castor [2-26] in smell, but bitter to the taste. It is
called thrausma. The earthy or stony is called phurama. It
grows in Libya near Ammon’s temple and is the juice of a
tree similar to ferula. It is softening, attracting and
warming, and dissolves hardness and inflammation of
bones. A decoction (taken as a drink) brings down the
intestines and is an abortifacient. One teaspoonful of a
decoction (taken as a drink with vinegar) lessens the
spleen, and takes away pains of the joints and hips.
Licked with honey (or sipped with juice of barley water)
it also helps the asthmatic, orthopnoeic [those with
difficulty breathing], epileptics, and those who have
moisture in the chest. It expels bloody urine, cleans white
spots on the cornea [eye], and removes the roughness of
the gene [cheeks, chin, eye sockets]. Pounded into small
 483
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

pieces with vinegar and applied, it softens hard lumps
around the spleen and liver. Applied with honey or
mixed with pitch, it dissolves knobs around the joints
[arthritis]. Rubbed on mixed with vinegar, saltpetre
[potassium nitrate], and oil cyprinum [1-65], it is good for
weariness and sciatica (instead of medications to remove
fatigue). It is also called agasyllon, criotheos, or heliastrus,
and the Romans call it gutta.
3-99. SARKOKOLLA
SUGGESTED: Sarcocolla [Bedevian] — Sarcocol 
Sarcocolla is the fluid of a tree growing in Persia (similar
to thin frankincense) dark yellow, and somewhat
bitter to the taste. It is able to close open cuts and sore
wounds, and to stop fluids in the eyes. It is mixed with
plasters. It is counterfeited by gum being mixed with it.
3-100. GLAUKION
SUGGESTED: Chelidonium corniculatum, Glaucium corniculatum,
Glaucium leiocarpum, Glaucium phoeniceum 
— Red Horned Poppy 
see 4-64
Glaucium is the juice of a herb that grows at Hierapolis 
in Syria. The leaves are similar to the horned poppy
but fatter, scattered on the ground, with a strong scent,
and more bitter to the taste. It has considerable quantities
of saffron-coloured juice. The inhabitants throw the
leaves into a pot, warm it in half-cold ovens until
withered, and afterwards beat them to press out the juice. 
It is used for new eye sores because it is cooling. 
3-101. KOLLA 
SUGGESTED: Glue from the hides of Bulls
The best glutinum (also called xylocolla or taurocolla) is
that from Rhodes made from bull hides. It is white
and transparent, but the black glue is bad. Dissolved in
vinegar it is able to take away impetigo [skin infection] and

leprosy on the outside of the skin. Diluted with warm
water and smeared on, it prevents burns from blistering.
Diluted with honey and vinegar it is good for wounds.
3-102. ICHTHUOKOLLA
SUGGESTED: Fish Glue
That called fish glue is from the intestines of a whale
fish. The best is made in Pontus — white, somewhat
rough, not scabby, very quickly melted. It is good to
include in head plasters, medicines for leprosy, and
medicines for making facial skin smooth.
3-103. IXOS 
SUGGESTED: Viscum album [Linnaeus], Loranthus europaeus 
— Continental Mistletoe 
PARTS ARE POISONOUS
The best ixia is new, the colour of a leek on the inside,
and pale yellow on the outside, with no part rough or 
branny. It is made of a certain round fruit (with leaves
similar to box) that grows on the oak. This fruit is
pounded, then washed, and afterwards boiled in water,
but some process it by chewing it. It also grows on the
apple tree, pear tree and other trees. It is able to disperse,
soften, attract, and digest swellings and inflammation of
the parotid gland and other suppurations, mixed equally
with wax and rosin. It heals epinyctis [ pustules which
appear only at night] in an adhesive plaster. With
frankincense it softens old ulcers and malignant
suppurations. Boiled (with quicklime, agate stone, or
asiatic [ Centella asiatica  — asiaticoside]) and applied, it
reduces the spleen. Smeared with arsenic or sacarach
[saccharate — salt of saccharic acid] it also draws off nails. 
Mixed with unslaked lime and wine sediment, its
strength is extended.

SUGGESTED: Aparine vulgaris [Bauhin], Galium aparine
— Catch Grass, Cleavers, Goosegrass, Sticky Willy 
Aparine has many little square rough branches. The
leaves are at distances lying about in a circle (like
those of rubia [dyer’s madder]). The flowers are white; the 
seed hard, white, round, somewhat hollow in the middle
(like a navel). The herb sticks to cloths, and the shepherds 
use it instead of a strainer for milk, for taking out hairs
with it. The seed, stalks and leaves are juiced (taken as a
drink with wine) to help those bitten by harvest spiders
and snakes. The juice dropped in ears cures earache. The
herb (taken in pounded swines’ grease) dissolves
scrofulous tumours [glandular swelling] and goitres. It is
also called ampelocarpum, omphelocarpum, philanthropum,
and ixos. 
3-105. ALUSSON
SUGGESTED: Marrubium alysson, Marrubium alyssum 
— Plaited-leaved Horehound, Moonwort 
Sprengel says this is Alyssum alpestre [Loudon].
Alysson is a somewhat rough little shrub with round
leaves. The fruit is similar to little double shields, in
which is the somewhat broad seed. It grows in hilly and
rough places. A decoction of this (taken as a drink)
dissolves afflictions in those without fever. When held or
smelled it has a similar effect. Pounded into small pieces
with honey it cleans freckles. Pounded together in meat
and given, it is thought to cure madness in a dog. Hanged 
in a house it is said to be wholesome and an amulet for
men and beasts. Hanged on them with a purple cloth, it
drives away sores on cattle. It is also called aspidium,
haplophyllon, accuseton, or adeseton.

Vincetoxicum officinale [in Sprague] — Milkweed
[other usage] Asclepias syriaca — Milkweed, Silkweed 
 Thapsia asclepium [Loudon] — Deadly Carrot 
POISONOUS
Asclepias sends out many long little branches (similar
to cissus), and slender roots with a sweet scent. The
flower smells strongly, and the seed is rather like that of
securidaca (that which gives peace). It grows on hills. A
decoction of the roots (taken as a drink in wine) helps
those with griping and those bitten by poisonous beasts.
The leaves are applied for malignant sores in the breasts
and womb. It is also called cission, or cissophullon.
3-107. ATRAKTULIS
SUGGESTED: Atractylis mitior, Cartamus sylvestris,
 Wilder Feldsaffran [Fuchs], Atractylis vulgaris minor [Brunfels],

[other usage] Atractylis gummifera, Carlina gummifera 
— White Chameleon, Spindle Wort
Atractylis is a thorn similar to cnicus [ 4-119, 4-190] with 
much longer leaves on the top of the shoots, and
most of it is naked and rough. Women use it instead of a
spindle. It has prickly little heads on the top and a pale
flower, but the root is thin and useless. The leaves,
filaments, and fruit of this plant (pounded into small
pieces and taken as a drink with pepper and wine) help
those touched by scorpions. Some relate that those
touched this way are without pain as long as they hold
the herb, and taking it away are in pain again. It is also
called amyron, cnicus sylvestris, or aspidium; the Magi call it 
aphedros, the Egyptians, cheno, the Romans, presepium,
some, fusus agrestis, and others, colus.

SUGGESTED: Polycnemum arvense, Polycnemum recurvum
Polycnemon is a shrub full of sprigs, with leaves similar
to origanum, and a stalk with many joints like
pulegium [3-36]. It does not have a tuft but little clusters on 
the top with a certain sharp, pleasant smell. It is effective
(applied green, or dried, with water) for closing open cuts 
and sore wounds. You must loosen it after it has been
applied for five days. It is taken in a drink with wine for
slow painful urination and hernia. (Experience has
taught how the little branches bruised in white wine are a 
great help for those possessed with the so-called water
delirium.) It is also called clinopodium, polygonatum, colus
iovis, or echeonymon, and the Romans call it puteo-
logonthria.
3-109. KLINOPODION
SUGGESTED: Clinopodium vulgare, Melissa clinopodium,
 Calamintha clinopodium — Wild Basil, Horse Thyme,
 Field Wild Basil
see 3-50, 4-176
Clinopodium is a little shrub full of shoots two feet high 
that grows on rocks, with leaves similar to serpyllum
[3-46], and flowers like the feet of a bed, set around at
distances, similar to marrubium [3-38]. The herb (and a
decoction of it) is taken as a drink for the bites of
venomous creatures, convulsions, hernia, and slow
painful urination. A decoction (taken as a drink for many
days) draws out the menstrual flow, is an abortifacient,
and casts off hanging warts. It stops discharges of the
bowels boiled down two thirds and taken as a drink (in
wine for the non-feverish, but for the feverish with
water). It is also called cleollicum, ocimoides, or zopyrum.

SUGGESTED: Leontice leontopetalum — Leontice, Lion's Leaf,
Lion's Turnip 
Leontopetalum sends out a stalk twenty centimetres
long (or rather more) with many wings on whose
tops are pods similar to cicer [2-126]. In these are two or
three little seeds. The flowers are a Phoenician colour
[red] (similar to anemone), but the leaves are similar to
colewort [kale], cut-in like those of poppy. The root is
black like rapum [turnip] with abnormal growths (as it
were), some knotty. It grows in fields and among wheat.
A decoction of the root (taken as a drink with wine) helps
those bitten by snakes, quickly relieving their pain. It is
also mixed with enemas or suppositories for sciatica. It is
also called leontopodium, leontium, doricteris, lychnis
sylvestris, doris, pardale, thorybethron, rapeium, papaver
corniculatum, or anemone; the Romans call it papaverculum,
and semen leoninum.
3-111. TEUKRION

[other usage] Teucrium creticum, Teucrium hyssopifolium 
— Cretan Germander 
 Teucrium scordioides, Teucrium scorodinia 
— Wood Germander, Wood Sage, Garlic Sage 
Teucrium is a herb like a rod (resembling germander),
with a thin leaf similar to that of cicer [2-126]. It grows
abundantly in Cilicia (in that part near Gentias), and
Kissas. A decoction (taken green, as a drink with posca
[hot drinks]; or dried, boiled, and taken excessively as a
drink) is able to diminish the spleen. With figs and
vinegar it is applied to the splenical. For those bitten by
poisonous beasts it is applied with vinegar alone
(without figs). Some call this chamedrys, others, teucris.

Chamaedrys vulgaris mas, Veronica teucrium,
 Veronica chamaedrys [Linnaeus], Chamaedrys vulgaris foemina
[Fuchs] — Wild Germander, Germander Speedwell
Chamaedrys grows in rough rocky places. It is a small
shrub twenty centimetres long, with bitter little
leaves similar in shape and in the jagging to an oak. The
little flower is pale purple. It must be gathered when full
of seed. Freshly picked (boiled with water and given as a
drink) it is able to help convulsions and coughs, as well as
spleens with hardened swellings, frequent painful
urination, and dropsy at first presentation. It expels the
menstrual flow and is an abortifacient. A decoction
(taken as a drink with vinegar) reduces the spleen. A
decoction is good against venomous creatures, taken as a
drink with wine and smeared on. Pounded into small
pieces, it may also be formed into pills for the purposes
previously mentioned. It is pounded into small pieces
with honey to clean old ulcers. Rubbed on with oil it takes 
away dimness in the eyes. Rubbed on, it is warming. The
Romans call it trissago minor, some chamedrops, or linodrys,
but because it has a certain similarity to teucrium, some
also have called it teucrium.
3-113. LEUKAS 
SUGGESTED: Leucas foliis rotundus, Phlomis biflora [Roxburgh];
Leucas indica — Leucas 
Leucas of the hill [wild] is broader-leaved than the
cultivated. The seed is sharper, more bitter, and
worse-tasting in the mouth, yet it is more effective than
the cultivated. Both of them (smeared on and taken as a
drink) are good with wine against the venom of
poisonous creatures, especially those of the sea.

Lychnis has a flower similar to a white violet but almost 
purple, interwoven into little crowns, the seed of
which (taken in a drink with wine) helps those bitten by
scorpions. It is also called athanates, aquilonium, vallarium,
geranopodium, corymbion, taurion, sceptrum, or maloion; the

SUGGESTED: Lychnis viscaria — Viscid Campion
Lychnis sylvestris is similar to the culivated in all things. 
Two teaspoons of a decoction of the seed (taken as a
drink) expels bilious matter through the intestines and
helps those touched by scorpions. They say that when
this herb is laid near scorpions they become numb and
unable to hurt. It is also called tragonoton, atocion,
hieracopodion, or lampas, the Egyptians call it semura, the
Magi call it genitals of a menstrual woman, the Romans,
intybus agrestis, some, lapathum, or caphaguina, and others,

ointment called lirinum or susinum [1-62] that soothes the
sinews, and is effective for hard lumps around the womb. 
 499
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK
Lychnis viscaria
after FAGUET — 1888

The leaves are applied to help those bitten by snakes.
Boiled, they are good for burns, and preserved in vinegar
they are good for wounds. The juice from the leaves
(mixed with vinegar or honey and boiled in a brass jar) is
a liquid medicine for old ulcers and new wounds. The
root (roasted and pounded into small pieces with
rosaceum [1-53]) cures and soothes the womb, expels the
menstrual flow, and heals ulcers, making a new skin.
Pounded into small pieces with honey it cures distresses
of the nerves, cleans leprosy and alphos [noncontagious
leprosy], takes off dandruff, clears the face, and removes
wrinkles. Pounded into small pieces with vinegar (or
with the leaves of hyoscyamus [4-69] and wheat flour) it
soothes inflammation from stones [ urinary, kidney]. A
decoction of the seed (taken as a drink) is an antidote for
snakebite. Both the seed and the leaves (pounded into
small pieces) are a poultice with wine for erysipela
[streptococcal skin infection]. Some say that there are lily
flowers of a purple colour. Those most effective for the
manufacture of ointment grow in Syria, and in Pisidia
near Pamphylia. It is also called crinanthemom, or
callirium, the Magi call it sanguis martis, Osthenes calls it

Ballota (or marrubium nigrum ) sends out many black
stalks that are four-cornered and somewhat rough
from one root. The leaves are similar to marrubium [3-38,
3-42] yet bigger, rounder, black and rough, spaced at
distances along the stalk (like apiastrum), with a strong
scent (which is why they have called it apiastrum); and the 
flowers lie around the white stalks in a circle. The leaves
(applied with salt) are good for those bitten by dogs.
Warmed in warm ashes until withered, they repress skin
lesions, and with honey they clean foul ulcers. It is also

Melissophyllum some call melittena because bees
delight in the herb. The leaves and little stalk are
similar to ballota [3-117], but these are bigger, thinner, not
so rough, and smell of lemon. A decoction of the leaves
(taken as a drink with wine, and also applied) is good for
those touched by scorpions, or bitten by harvest spiders
or dogs. A decoction of them is a warm pack for the same
purposes. It is suitable for women’s hip baths for moving
the menstrual flow, as a mouth rinse for toothache, and
as an enema or suppository for dysentery. A decoction of
the leaves (taken as a drink with saltpetre [potassium
nitrate]) helps those who are ill from mushrooms or
griping. Taken as a linctus [syrup] it helps difficult
breathing, and applied with salt it dissolves scrofulous
tumours [ goitres] and cleans ulcers. Smeared on, it
lessens the pains of gout. It is also called melitteon,
meliphyllon, erythra, or temele; the Romans call it apiastrum,

see 3-42
Prasium is a shrub with many branches from one root,
somewhat rough, white and four-cornered in the
stems. The leaf is equal to a big finger, somewhat round,
thick, wrinkled, bitter to the taste. The seed lies on the
stalks at distances and the flowers are sharp like the
vertebrae of backbones. It grows in places near houses
and rubbish of buildings. 
The dried leaves (with the seed) boiled with water (or
juiced while green) are given with honey for tuberculosis
of the lungs, asthma, and coughs. If dry iris is mixed with
it, it brings up thick stuff out of the chest. It is given to
women not yet cleansed for driving out the menstrual
flow and the afterbirth, to women in hard labour, to those 
bitten by venomous creatures, and to those who have
taken some deadly thing as a drink. Yet it is offensive to
the bladder and veins. The leaves (smeared on with
honey) clean foul ulcers, drive away pterygium
[membrane on eye] and gangrenous ulceration of the
cheeks, and lessen pains of the sides. The juice made
from the pressed leaves (thickened in the sun) provides
for the same purposes. Rubbed on with wine and honey
it is a sight restorer, and it purges away jaundice through
the nostrils. Dropped in by itself or with rosaceum [1-53] it
is good for earaches. It is also called eupatorium,
phyllophares, tripedilon, camel’s foot, or philophares; the
Egyptians call it asterope, the Magi, sanguis tauri , some,
aphedros, genitura hori , the Romans, marrubium, some,
labeonia, and the Africans, atierberzia.

Stachys is a shrub similar to marrubium [3-38] yet
somewhat longer; with many thin leaves, somewhat
rough, hard, with sweet scent, white; with many small
shoots out of the same root, but paler than those of
marrubium. It grows in rough hilly places, and it is
warming and sharp. As a result a decoction of the leaves
(taken as a drink) expels the menstrual flow and
afterbirth.

SUGGESTED: Asplenium scolopendrium, Scolopendrium vulgare,
Scolopendrium officinarum, Phyllitis scolopendrium, 
Adiantum scolopendrium — Hart’s Tongue Fern,

Phyllitis sends out six or seven upright leaves similar to 
rumex [2-141] yet somewhat longer and more
flourishing, smooth on the front parts, but on the back
parts having (as it were) thin little worms hanging. It
grows in shady places and pleasure gardens. It is bitter to
the taste and has no stalk, seed, or flower. A decoction of
the leaves (taken as a drink with wine) is good for those
bitten by snakes. It is helpful for four-footed beasts
[veterinary] poured in through the mouth. It is taken as a
drink for dysentery and diarrhoea. It is also called phyllis,
acaulon, or lapathum sylvestre.
3-122. PHALAGGION

 507
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

distant from one another. The flowers are white like lilies
with many in-cuts. The seed is thick and black similar to
half of a lens [lentil] but much more slender. The small
little root is thin and green while being pulled out of the
earth; afterwards it contracts. It grows in hilly places. A
decoction of the leaves, seeds, and flowers (taken as a
drink with wine) helps those touched by scorpions or
bitten by harvest spiders. It also dissolves griping.
3-123. TRIPHULLON
SUGGESTED: Trifolium odoratum, Lotus sativa [Fuchs],
Lotus hortensis odora [Bauhin], Trifolium melilotus-coerulea
[Linnaeus], Trigonella coerulea [in Sprague] — Trefoil
[other usage] Trigonella corniculata, Trigonella eliator 
— Wild Trefoil 
Trifolium is a shrub higher than a foot, with slender
black stems like onion stalks with branches attached.
These have are three leaves on every sprig (like the lotus
tree). The smell of them when they emerge is like rue
[3-52, 3-53, 4-98], but when grown it is like bitumen. It
sends out a purple flower; the seed is somewhat broad
and rough with at the one end (as it were), a horn. The
root is thin, long and strong. The seeds and leaves (taken
as a drink in water) help pleurisy, frequent painful
urination, epilepsy, those beginning to have dropsy, and
womb congestion. It expels the menstrual flow, but three
teaspoonfuls of the seed or four teaspoonfuls of the
leaves must be given. A decoction of the leaves (pounded
into small pieces and taken as a drink with vinegar and
honey) helps those bitten by venomous creatures. Some
say that a decoction of the entire shrub with roots and
leaves applied with hot cloths to those bitten by snakes
soothes the pains, but if someone with an ulcer is applied
with hot cloths from the water in which another was
healed he feels the same pains as those bitten did. Some
give three leaves in drink for fevers with recurrent
paroxysms, or three seeds with wine for dissolving the
circular flows of acute fevers. The root is also mixed with
antidotes. It is also called oxyphyllon, menyanthes,
asphaltium, orcnicinum, the Romans call it trifolium, and
some, trifolium acutum odoratum.

Polion the mountainous is also called teuthris, and it is
useful. It is a thin little white shrub twenty
centimetres long, full of seed; with a small head on the
top similar to a little corymbus [flat or slightly convex
inflorescence], like gray hair, strongly scented with a
pleasant smell. Some is shrubbier, not altogether as
strong to smell, and not as effective in working. A
decoction (taken as a drink with vinegar) is able to help
those bitten by venomous creatures, or with dropsy, or
jaundice, and the splenetic; but it causes headaches and
is bad for the stomach. It also induces movement of the
intestines and the menstrual flow. Scattered underneath
(or inhaled) it drives away venomous creatures. Applied,
it heals wounds. It is also called teuthrion, pheuxaspidion,
achaemenis, ebenitis, melosmon, belion, or leontocharon.
3-125. SKORDION

Scordium grows in marshy, mountainous places. It has
leaves similar to chamedrys but bigger and not as
cut-in around the circumference. It resembles garlic in its
smell somewhat, and is astringent and bitter to the taste.
Pale red flowers grow from the little four-cornered stalks. 
The pounded herb (green or dry) is warming and diuretic 
given in drink. Boiled with wine it is good for snakebite
and poisons. For pangs of hunger in the stomach,
dysentery, and frequent painful urination give two
teaspoonfuls with honey water. It expels purulent
thicknesses out of the chest. It helps old coughs, hernias,
and convulsions mixed dry in a linctus [syrup] with
nasturtium [2-185], honey and rosin. Used in a stiff
ointment it relaxes hypochondrium [ nervous gastric
disorder] with long-lasting inflammation. Smeared on
with sharp vinegar (or applied with water) it is good for
gout. Applied, it induces the menstrual flow, and heals
wounds. With honey it cleans old ulcers and brings them
 511
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

to a scar. Used dry, it restrains abnormal growths of the
flesh. The juice is taken as a drink for the same sores. The
most effective is the Pontic and Cretan. It is also called
scorbium, pleuritis, dysosmon, calamintha sylvestris ,
chamedrys, or mithridanios; the Magi call it sanguis podotis,
the Egyptians, apho, and the Romans, trisago palustris.

Ocymum abyssinicum, Ocymum filamentosum — Becium 
Loudon remarks that Bekion is a name for sage in Dioscorides; see 3-145, Orminon.
Bechium has six or seven leaves (similar to cissus but
bigger) growing from the root — white on the lower
side but green on the upper side — with many corners.
The stalk is twenty centimetres long. It has a pale yellow
flower in the springtime but it quickly throws off both the 
flower and the stalk; as a result some have thought the
herb to be without stalk or flower. The root is thin and of
no use. It grows near flowing or gushing watery places.
The leaves (pounded into small pieces and applied) cure
erysipela [ streptococcal skin infection] and all
inflammations. It is dried and burned, and the smoke
from it is inhaled through a funnel to cure those troubled
with a dry cough or difficult breathing: opening the
mouth wide they take the smoke in at the mouth and
swallow it down. It breaks up abscesses in the chest, and
the burning root (inhaled) does the same. Boiled in honey 
water and taken as a drink it expels dead embryos. It is
also called richion, petrina, peganon, pithion, pagonaton,
chameleuce, procheton, arcophyton, or chamegiron. The
Egyptians call it saartha, the Romans, tussilago, some,
pharpharia, others, pustulago, and the Bessians call it asa.

smaller, the flowers little, thin and white, with a strong
smell; it flowers in the summer. Some (in the
Mediterranean parts) call a slender-branched little herb
with a single stalk, extremely small, abundant with
flowers of a tawny yellow colour, Artemisia monoclonos.
The scent of this is sweeter than of the other. They both
warm and relieve. Boiled, they are good put into
womens’ baths for driving out the menstrual flow and
afterbirth, as an abortifacient, for the closure and
inflammation of the womb, the breaking of stones
[urinary, kidney], and stoppage of urine. Much of the
herb applied to the lower part of the bowels induces the
menstrual flow, and the juice (kneaded together with
myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116] and applied) draws from the
womb as many things as does bathing; three
teaspoonfuls of the filaments is given in drink to bring
out the same things. If anyone has the herb artemisia with
him while travelling it dissolves weariness, and if you
wear it on your feet it drives away venomous beasts and
devils. After blood has hardened around the joints, take
the bigger branches with rosaceum [1-53] and (having
boiled them in a pot) rub the sick man all over with this as

he goes to sleep. It helps womens' womb congestion
considerably, and soothes slow painful urination and
rupture of the opisthotonum [form of tetanus]. It is also
called toxetesia, ephesia, anactorios, sozusa, lea, or lycophrys;
the Magi call it sanguis hominis , it is also called
chrysanthemon, the Romans call it salentia, some, serpyllum, 
others, herba regia , rapium, tertanageta, or artenisia, the
Gauls call it ponem, and the Dacians, zuoste.
3-128. ARTEMISIA LEPTOPHULLOS 
SUGGESTED: Artemisia herba alba — Artemisia 
Artemisia grows around rivulets and hedges and in
sown fields. The flowers and bruised leaves of this
give off the smell of sampsuchum [3-47]. Therefore if
anyone is suffering in his stomach he should pound this
herb well with oil of almonds, and make (as it were) a
warm compress and lay it on the stomach, and he shall be 
healed. If anyone is pained in his strength, having mixed
the juice of this with oil of roses let him rub with it, and he 
shall be whole.
3-129. AMBROSIA 
SUGGESTED: Ambrosia maritima — Sea Ambrosia, 
Oak of Cappodocia, Oak of Jerusalem
 Ambrosia artemisifolia — Common Ragweed 
Ambrosia is a little shrub three feet in height, full of
branches, with small leaves like rue around the
emergent stalk. It has small stems full of little seeds like
little bunches of grapes, which never flower — smelling
pleasant like wine. The root is slender, two feet long. In
Cappadocia it is plaited into wreaths for the head. It is
able to repress and repel, and is smeared on as an
astringent for fluids that have come down. It is also called 
botrys, or botrys artemisia , the Romans call it caper
sylvaticus, or apium rusticum, and the Egyptians, merseo.

Chamaedrys vera foemina [Fuchs], Botrys Chamaedryoides
[Bauhin], Teucrium botrys — Cut-leaved Germander 
see 3-112
Botrus is a yellowish herb like a shrub, broad-spread,
having many wings, and the seed grows around all
the branches. The many leaves are similar to chicory, and
all of it has a wonderful sweet scent, and so it is also laid
among cloths. It grows especially near running waters
and brooks. A decoction (with wine) is used as a drink to
ease difficult breathing. The Cappadocians call this
ambrosia, and it is also called artemisa.

[Fuchs], Geranium robertianum [Linnaeus] — Herb Robert,
Adder’s Tongue, Fox Geranium 
Geranium sextum [Fuchs], Geranium sanguinem [Linnaeus],
Geranium praetense, Geranium fuscum — Crane’s Bill 
Geranium has a jagged leaf similar to anemone but
longer; a root somewhat round, sweet when eaten.
A teaspoonful of a decoction (taken as a drink in wine)
dissolves swellings of the vulva. It has slender little
downy stalks two feet long; leaves like mallow; and on
the tops of the wings certain abnormal growths looking
upward (like the heads of cranes with the beaks, or the
teeth of dogs), but there is no use for it in medicine. It is
also called pelonitis, trica, or geranogeron, the Romans call it 
echinaster, the Africans iesce; it is also called alterum
geranium by some, but others call it oxyphyllon, mertryx,
myrrhis cardamomum,  or origanum. The Magi call it
hierobryncas, the Romans, pulmonia, some, cicotria, some,
herba gruina, and the Africans, ienk.

Filago germanica [Linnaeus] — Cudweed
[other usage] Gnaphalium citrinum, Gnaphalium stoechas,  
Helichrysum stoechas — Cassidony, Gold Flower,
 Golden Tufts 
Some use gnaphalium leaves instead of flocks [scraps of
wool] because they are white and soft. The leaves
(given to drink with hard wine) are good for dysentery. It
is also called hires, mertryx, anaxeton or anaphalis, the
Egyptians call it semeon, the Gauls, gelasonen, the Romans,
centunculus, some tucularis, and some, albinus.

 Typha angustifolia [Linnaeus] — Lesser Reedmace 
Typha angustata — Reed Mace, Small Bulrush 
Typhe sends out a leaf similar to cyprus [1-124], and a
stalk smooth and equal, surrounded around on the
top with thick flowers which turn into down. It is also
called panicula. The flowers (used in old washed swines’
grease) cure burns. It grows in marshes and places with
standing water. 
3-134. KIRKAIA 
SUGGESTED: Circaea lutetiana 
— Common Enchanter’s Nightshade 
 Circaea alpina — Alpine Enchanter’s Nightshade 
Circea (also called diraea) has leaves similar to garden
solanum nigrum  [4-74], many shoots, many small
black flowers, and seed similar to milium [3-158] in certain 
(as it were) little horns. The three or four roots are twenty
centimetres long, white, sweet smelling, warming. It
grows chiefly in some rocky, windy and open sunny
 516
ROOTS OF AKANTHODA or PRICKLY PLANTS 

places. As much as three pounds of the root (bruised and
steeped a day and a night in three pints of sweet wine
and taken as a drink for three days) cleans the womb. The 
seed (taken in liquids and sipped) draws down milk.
3-135. OINANTHE

— Water Hemlock, Horsebane, Fine-leaved Water Dropwort 
POISONOUS
Oenanthe has leaves like staphulinus, with white
flowers and a thick stalk twenty centimetres long.
The seed is like atriplex [1-120, 2-145], and it has a great
root with many round heads. It grows on rocks. The seed, 
stalks and leaves are given to drink (with honeyed wine)
to discharge the afterbirth. The root is good (with wine)
for slow painful urination and jaundice. It is also called
leucanthon, or kerascomion.
3-136. KONUZA 
SUGGESTED: Conyza odorata, Pluchea odorata — Ovrabla 
 Conyza squarrosa — Great Fleabane
 Conyza canadensis, Erigeron canadensis — Fleabane, Erigeron
Conyza magna . The conyza called little has a better
smell, but the bigger sort has a higher stalk, broader
leaves and a strong scent; both have leaves similar to the
olive but these are rough and thick. The height of the
stalk of the bigger sort is two feet, but the lesser is a foot.
The flower is foul, a tawny yellow, somewhat bitter,
falling into down. The roots are useless. The shrub is
scattered underneath with the leaves, and the smoke of
these is inhaled to drive away poisonous beasts, keep off
gnats, and kill fleas. The leaves are usefully laid on those
bitten by snakes, and on swellings and wounds; and the
flowers and leaves are taken in a drink with wine for
expulsion of the menstrual flow, as an abortifacient, and
for slow painful urination, griping and jaundice. A
 517
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

decoction (taken as a drink with vinegar) helps epilepsy,
and a decoction as a hip bath cures disorders in the womb 
and cleans away the menstrual flow. The juice (applied)
causes abortions. The herb rubbed on with oil is good for
chills. Thinly applied, it cures headaches. It is also called
cynozematitis, danais, tanachium, phycos, ischys, or dinosmos,
the Magi call it brephoctonos, some, anubias, or hedemias,
the Egyptians, ceti, the Romans, intubus, some, militaris
mina, delliarion, febrifuga, phragmosa, alusteri, or pissan.
Conyza parva. There is also a third kind of conyza but
the stalk is thicker and softer and the leaves bigger than
the smaller sort. It is weaker than the bigger, not fat but
with a much stronger smell, more unpleasant and less
effective; it grows in watery places. It is also called panios
or libanotis; the Magi call it cronos.
3-137. EMEROKALLIS 
SUGGESTED: Hemerocallis fulva — Lemon Lily, 
Yellow Day Lily
Hemerocallis has leaves and a stalk similar to a lily,
green like leeks, the flowers in threes or fours at
every flowering, similar in their shape to a lily when they
begin to open, with a colour very similar to ochre. The
root is pounded finely like the great bulbus [2-200, 2-201]
and taken as a drink or applied with honey in wool as a
pessary for drawing out water and blood. The leaves
(pounded into small pieces and applied) lessen
inflammation of the breasts that comes with childbirth,
and inflammation of the eyes. The root and leaves are
effective applied on burns. It is also called
hemerocatallacton, lilium sylvestre , crinanthemon,
porphyranthes, bulbus sanguineus,  or anticantharon; the
Egyptians call it iocroi, the Romans, bulbus, some, lilium
agreste, some, lilium marinum, and the Africans, abiblabon.

Leukoion is commonly known but there are different 
coloured flowers, for it is found white, yellowish and
azure [blue], or else it is purple. The fittest of these for
medicinal use is the yellowish, the dried flowers of which
(boiled) are good for bathing inflammation around the
womb and expelling the menstrual flow. Used in wax
ointments they cure cracks in the perineum, and with
honey they cure apthas [small ulcers]. Two teaspoonfuls
of a decoction of the seed (taken as a drink with wine or
applied as a pessary with honey) draw out the menstrual
flow and afterbirth, and are an abortifacient. The roots
(smeared on with vinegar) repress the spleen and help
gout. It is also called basilion; the Romans call it opula alba,
some call it viola alba, augustia, viola matronalis, passarina,
or polyphura.
3-139. KRATAIOGONON
SUGGESTED: Crataegus monogyna — Common Hawthorn 
 Crataegus orientalis — Eastern Thorn
 Crataegus laevigata, Crataegus oxyacantha 
— Midland Hawthorn
Crataeogonon (also called crateonon) has leaves similar
to melampyrum, many knotty shoots growing out of
one root, and a seed similar to millet. It grows for the most 
part in shady and shrubby places, and it is extremely
sharp. It is said by some that drinking the seed causes a
woman to bring forth a male child, if after the cleansing of 
 519
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

the menstrual flow and before the time of sexual
intercourse, she drinks three times a day (while fasting)
thirty grains with two cups of water for forty days, and
lets the man drink it similarly for as many days and then
lie with her. 
3-140. PHULLON 
SUGGESTED: Bryophyllum calycinum, Bryophyllum pinnatum 
— Air Plant, Floppers, Life Plant 
see 4-192
Phyllum grows on rocks. That which is called
thelygonon has (as it were) moss, the leaf greener than
the olive, a thin short stalk, a slender root, a white flower,
and a bigger seed, rather like poppy. Arrhenogonon is
similar in other things to that previously mentioned but
differs in having the seed (similar to olives) coming in a
cluster out of the flower. It is said that a decoction of
arrhenogonon (taken as a drink) produces male offspring,
but thelygonum causes females. Crateus relates this
concerning these, but he seems to me to relate these
things according to the report of them [not experience].
Some call this elaeophyllon, some, bryonia.
3-141. ORCHIS
SUGGESTED: Orchis mas latifolia [Fuchs, Brunfels], 
Cynosorchis latifolia [Bauhin], Orchis militaris [Linnaeus]
— Military Orchid, Soldier Orchid
[other usage] Orchis undulata — Wavy-leaved Orchis 
 Orchis longibracteta — Sicilian Orchis 
 Herminum monorchis, Ophrys monorchis — Musk Orchis 
Orchis (also called cynosorchis) has leaves scattered on
the earth around the stalk, and the bottom of it is
similar to an olive — tender but narrower, smooth and
longer; a stalk the height of twenty centimetres on which
are flowers of a purple hue. The root is bulbous,
somewhat long, narrow like the olive, double, one part
above, the other beneath, one full but the other soft and
full of wrinkles. The root is eaten (boiled) like bulbus
[2-200, 2-201]. It is said that if the bigger root is eaten by
 520
ROOTS OF AKANTHODA or PRICKLY PLANTS 

men, it makes their offspring males, and the lesser eaten
by women makes them conceive females. It is further
related that women in Thessalia give it to drink with
goat’s milk. The tenderer root is given to encourage
venereal diseases, and the dry root to suppress and
dissolve venereal diseases. In a decoction (taken as a
drink) the one dissolves the other. It grows in stony,
sandy places. 
3-142. ORCHIS ETEROS 
SUGGESTED: Triochis-serapias mas [Fuchs], Triorchis mas minor

— Bee Orchid
[other usage] Serapias lingua, Serapias cordigera — Serapias
Testiculus alter (also called serapias — as Acreas does for 
the many uses of the root) has leaves similar to leek,
somewhat long but broader and fat, winding around in
the wings; little stalks twenty centimetres long, the
flowers almost purple. The root (similar to testicles) lies
under, and applied is able to dissipate oedema, clean
ulcers, and repress herpes [viral infection]. Smeared on it
destroys fistulas, and soothes inflamed parts. Sprinkled
on dry it stops nomae [grazer disease, eats away muscle,
tissue and bones], and a decoction (taken as a drink with
wine) cures the intestines. There is a similar story told of
this as there is of the dog’s stone [cyanosorchis 3-141]. 
3-143. SATURION
SUGGESTED: Satyrion-trifolium [Fuchs],
 Orchis trifolia major [Bauhin], Orchis bifolia [Linnaeus],
Habenaria bifolia [Brunfels]
[other usage] Satyrium hircinum, Orchis hircina
 — Lizard Orchis 
Satyrium some call trifolium because it bears leaves in
threes (as it were) bending down to the earth, similar
to rumex [2-141] or lily, yet smaller and reddish. It has a
naked stalk a foot long, a white flower similar to a lily, a
 521
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

bulbous root as big as an apple — red, but white within,
similar to an egg, sweet to the taste and pleasant in the
mouth. One ought to drink it in black hard wine for
severe spasms, and use it if he wishes to lay with a
woman. For they say that this also is an aphrodisiac. 
3-144. SATURION ERUTHRONION
SUGGESTED: Satyrium-basilicum mas [Fuchs, Brunfels],

[other usage] Erythronium dens-canis — Dog’s-tooth Violet 
Modern satyrium species are only found at the Cape of Good Hope.
Satyrium erythronium has a seed similar to flax seed but
big, firm, glittering and smooth. It is said that it is an
aphrodisiac, like scincus. The bark of the root is somewhat 
thin and red, but the inside is white, pleasant in the
mouth to one who tastes it, and sweet. It grows in sunny,
hilly places. It is related that the root (taken into the hand) 
encourages venereal diseases, but even more so when a
decoction is taken as a drink with wine. It is also called
satyrium erythraicum , melium aquaticum , entaticon,
priapiscus, morion, satyriscus, or testiculum satyri ; the
Romans call it molorticulum veneris. 
3-145. ORMINON EMERON

Annual Clary
Cultivated horminum is an herb similar to marrubium
in the leaves, but the stalk is four-cornered and half a 
 522
ROOTS OF AKANTHODA or PRICKLY PLANTS 

foot high. There are abnormal growths similar to husks
around this (as it were) looking towards the root, in
which are two different types of seed. In the wild it is
found round and dark, but in the other it is somewhat
long and black. Use is made of this and it is also thought
that a decoction (taken as a drink with wine) is an
aphrodisiac. With honey it cleans away argema [small
white ulcer on the cornea], and also white spots on the
corneas of the eyes; and smeared on with water it
dissolves oedema and extracts splinters. The herb
(applied) does the same things. The wild one is stronger;
as a result it is mixed with compound ointments
(especially with gleucinum [1-67]). The Romans call it
geminalis, and the Dacians, hormia.
3-146. EDUSARON 
SUGGESTED: Hedysarum crinitum

 Biserrula pelecinus — Hatchet Vetch
Hedysarum (called pelecinus by the ointment makers)
is a shrub with little leaves similar to cicer [2-126],
but pods like little horns in which is the red seed similar
to an axe that has two edges (from which it is named). It is 
bitter to one who tastes it; a decoction (taken as a drink) is
good for the stomach, and it is also mixed with antidotes.
Taken as a pessary with honey before sexual intercourse
it is thought to hinder conception. It grows among barley
and wheat. 
3-147. ONOSMA 
SUGGESTED: Onosma echioides — Hairy Onosma
ALSO:  Onosma tauricum, Onosma orientale, Onosma sericeum
Onosma has soft leaves similar to those of anchusa,
somewhat long, the length of four fingers but the
breadth of one finger, scattered on the earth very like
those of anchusa [4-23 to 4-26]; but it is without stalk, seed,
or flowers. The little root lies underneath, somewhat
 523
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

long, weak, thin, and reddish. It grows in rough places. A
decoction of the leaves of this (taken as a drink in wine) is
an abortifacient. They say also that if one with child walks 
over this herb, she aborts. It is also called osmas, phlonitis,
or ononis.
3-148. NUMPHAIA 
SUGGESTED: Nymphaea candida [Fuchs],
Nymphaea alba major [Bauhin], Nymphaea alba [Linnaeus]
— Water Nymph, White Water Lily, Flatter Dock
Nymphaea grows in marshes and standing waters; it
has many leaves similar to those of the Egyptian
bean, yet smaller and somewhat longer, all from the same 
root, some (in a way) standing above the water, and
others also in the water. The flowers are white, similar to
a lily, with the middle a saffron colour, but when it has
done blooming it becomes round in a circumference like
an apple, or the head of poppy — black; in which is a
black seed, broad, thick, clammy to the taste. The stalk is
smooth, not thick, black, similar to that of the Egyptian
bean. The root is black, coarse, like a sceptre, and it is
harvested in the autumn. This (dried and taken as a drink 
with wine) helps coeliac [ intestinal] complaints and
dysentery, and reduces the spleen. The root is applied for 
disorders of the stomach and bladder; with water it takes
away psoriasis, and applied with pitch it cures baldness.
The root is taken as a drink for lecherous dreams because
it relieves these. It causes a faintness of the genitals for a
few days if one drinks it continuously, and a decoction of
the seed (taken as a drink) does the same. It seems to be
called nymphaea because it loves watery places. It is found
in abundance at Helis on the river Anigrus, and in
Aliartus, Boeotia.

SUGGESTED: Nymphaea lutea [Fuchs], 
Nymphaea lutea major [Bauhin], Nymphaea lutea [Linnaeus],
 Nymphaea luteum, Nuphar luteum [in Sprague] 
— Yellow Water Lily, Brandy Bottle 
There is also another nymphaea (the flower of which is
called nuphar) which has leaves similar to that
previously mentioned, but it has a coarse white root, and
a glittering yellowish flower (like a rose). A decoction of
the root and seed (taken as a drink in black wine) is good
for the excessive menstrual discharges of women. It
grows in places around Thessalia near the river Peneus. It 
is also called nymphona.
3-150. ANDROSACES
SUGGESTED: Androsace lactea — Androsace, Sea Navelwort 
ALSO: Androsace obtusifolia
Androsaces grows in sea-bordering places in Syria. The 
herb is thin, with slender, bitter, leafless branches,
having on its head a pod containing the seed. Two
teaspoonfuls of a decoction (taken as a drink with wine)
is able to encourage much urine in dropsy; and a
decoction of the herb and the seed (taken as a drink) does
the same. It is smeared usefully upon gout. It is also called 
picras, leuce, or thalassia. 
3-151. ASPLENON

Asplenon has many leaves (similar to the creatures
called centipedes and millipedes) growing round
about out of one root. It grows on walls and shady rocks
or pebble stones — stalkless, flowerless, seedless, [its
leaves] cut-in like those of fern, yellowish and rough
underneath, but green above. The leaves (boiled with
 525
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

vinegar and taken as a drink for forty days) are able to
reduce the spleen, but you must also rub the spleen with
the leaves pounded into small pieces with wine. It helps
slow painful urination, hiccups and jaundice, and breaks
stones in the bladder. It is thought to be a cause of
barrenness (used alone or hung about one with the
spleen of a mule) but they say that to cause barrenness it
must be dug up when the night is moonless. It is also
called scolopendrium, splenium, hemionion, pteryx, lonchitis,
aturius, phrygia, phrygitis, or philtrodotes, while the Magi
call it the blood of a weasel.

Hemionitis puts out a horned leaf similar to
dracunculus [2-196b] (like the third-day moon). The
many slender roots are underneath, but it bears no stalk,
seed, or flower. It grows in rocky places. The herb is
astringent to the taste and is taken as a drink with vinegar 
to reduce the spleen. It is also called splenium.

SUGGESTED: Anthyllis vulneraria, Anthyllis prior 
— Kidney Vetch, Lady’s Fingers, Wound Wort  
 Anthyllis barba jovis — Jove’s Beard, Jupiter’s Beard
 Anthyllis cretica — Cretan Kidney Vetch
There are two types of anthyllis. One has leaves similar
to lens [lentils], and upright little branches the height
of twenty centimetres, with the leaves soft, the root
slender and little. It grows in sandy sunny places,
somewhat salty to the taste. The other kind is similar in its 
leaves and small branches to chamepitys [3-175], but they
are rougher, shorter, and sharper. The flower is a purple
colour, smelling extremely strong, the root like chicory.
Two teaspoonfuls of a decoction (taken as a drink) has
considerable strength to help frequent painful urination
 526
ROOTS OF AKANTHODA or PRICKLY PLANTS 

and inflamed kidneys. Pounded into small pieces and
given as a pessary (with rosaceum [1-53] and milk) they
soften inflammations of the womb. They also heal
wounds, and a decoction (taken as a drink with vinegar
and honey) of that which is similar to chamepitys heals
epilepsy (among other things). It is also called anthyllon,
anthemis, eranthemis, leucanthemon, soranthis, or flos
campestris; the Romans call it solaster.

Consolida regalis arvensis [Bauhin], 
Delphinium consolida [Linnaeus] — Forking Larkspur
There are three kinds of anthemis (differing only in
their flowers) the branches twenty centimetres long,
shrubby, with many wings. The smaller branches are
little, thin, many, with little round heads, within them
flowers of gold colour; but outside there are round about
white, yellowish, or purple leaves, the quantities like
those of rue. It grows in rough places and byways. It is
gathered in the spring. The roots, flowers, and herb have
a warming, relieving strength. Taken as a drink of a
decoction (or by bathing) they expel the menstrual flow,
are abortifacient, expel stones [ urinary, kidney], and
induce urine. They are taken as a drink for gaseousness,
and for suffering from intestinal obstruction; they clean
away jaundice, and cure liver ailments; and a decoction
of them is used in warm packs for the bladder. The most
effective for those troubled with stones is that of a purple
colour, which in all respects is the bigger, properly called
eranthemon. That called leucanthemon is more urinary, as
well as chrysanthemon. Smeared on they cure ulcers in the
inner angle of the eye. Chewed, they cure apta [aptha —
thrush in children or candidiasis]. Some also use it as a
 527
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

suppository (beating it finely with oil) for recurrent
fevers. The leaves and flowers must be stored when they
have been pounded apart and made into little balls. The
root is dried and stored. When there is need of it
sometimes give two parts of the herb, sometimes one part 
of the flower or root. Sometimes the opposite — give two
parts of the flower and one of the herb, doubling it by
turn every other day — and you must drink it in diluted
honey. (Chamomile pounded into small pieces with
rosaceum [1-53] cures fevers. It is an effective plant for
those who are reasonably well. The shortest is best and
grows in sandy places, and physicians remove them at
the beginning of spring). It is also called leucanthemon, or
eranthemon because it flowers in the spring; some call it
chamemelum because of the similarity of its smell to
apples; some call it melanthemon, chrysocome, or callias; the
Romans call it malium, and the Africans, astertiphe. 
3-155. PARTHENION (AMARAKON)
SUGGESTED: Amaracinum, Parthenium, Cotula foetida [Fuchs],
Chamaemelum foetidum [Bauhin], Anthemis cotula [Linnaeus]
 — Stinking Chamomile, Mayweed [Mabberley]
[other usage] Origanum amaracus — Amaracus 
 Origanum dictamnus, Dictamnus creticus, Amaracus dictamnus
— Dittany of Crete, Burning Bush
Parthenium has thin leaves (similar to coriander); the
white flowers are in a circle, their middle is yellow,
and they are somewhat poisonous to smell and bitter to
taste. Dried and taken as a drink with vinegar and honey
(or with salt) it is able to drive phlegm and cholera
downward and out, and to help the asthmatic and
depressive. The herb (without its flower) is effective
(given in drink) for urinary stones and the asthmatic. A
decoction of it is fit for bathing a hardened and inflamed
womb. It is applied (with its flowers) for skin
inflammation and other inflammation. It is also called
amaracum, leucanthemon, anthemis, chamemelum,
chrysocalis, melabathrum, or flos campestris; the Romans call
it solis oculus, or millefolium, the Etruscans, cautan, and the
Africans, thamacth.

SUGGESTED: Buphthalmum, Oculis bovis [Fuchs],
 Chamaemelum inodorum [Bauhin], Matricaria inodora
[Linnaeus] — False Chamomile, Scentless Mayweed
[other usage] Buphthalmum graveolens — Ox-eye
Buphthalmum salicifolium —Yellow Ox-eye Daisy
 Anthemis arvensis, Chamaemelum arvensis,  Buphthalmum 
— Corn Chamomile
It is believed that the buhphthalmum of Pliny is a species of anthemis [Loudon].
Buphthalmum sends out somewhat slender tender little 
stalks, leaves like marathrum [3-81], yellowish flowers 
— bigger than anthemis, similar to eyes (from which it is
named). It grows in fields and around towns. The flowers 
of this (pounded into small pieces with wax ointment)
dissolve oedema and hard lumps. They say that a
decoction (taken as a drink after coming out from a bath)
causes the jaundiced to have a good colour for some time.
You must gather buphthalmum while the moon is
increasing. It is used against fears, devils, enchantments,
and poisons (turning aside these things); and if anyone
chews the root (and afterwards spits it out) it
immediately stops mucus, eases toothache, and loosens
the bowels. It is also called cachlan, or balsamina, the Magi
call it haemorrha, some, genitura Mercurii , semen
incorruptibile, or mnesitheos; the Romans call it
kappacorania, and the Africans, narat.
3-157. PAIONIA ARREN, PAIONIA
THELEIA
SUGGESTED: Paeonia foemina [Fuchs], Paeonia communis
[Bauhin], Paeonia officinalis var foemina [Linnaeus]  
— Female Peony, Garden Peony 
POISONOUS
Peonia (or glycyside) some call pentoboron, and they call
the root paeonia. The stalk grows as high as two feet
with many branches. The male has leaves similar to the
carya [1-178], but the female is jagged in the leaves
(similar to smyrnium [3-78, 3-79]). It sends out certain
pods on the top of the stalk similar to almonds, which
opened are found to contain five or six little red grains
 529
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

similar to those of the pomegranate — black in the
middle, inclining to purple. The root of the male is about
the thickness of a finger and twenty centimetres in
height, astringent to taste, white. On the root of the
female there are seven or eight tubers similar to acorns,
like asphodelus [2-199]. The root is given to women who
are not cleansed after childbirth. The amount of an
almond (of a decoction taken as a drink) induces the
menstrual flow. A decoction (taken as a drink with wine)
helps pains in the intestines, jaundice, inflamed kidneys,
and pain in the bladder. A decoction (boiled in wine and
taken as a drink) stops discharges of the bowels. A
decoction of ten or twelve red grains of the seed (taken as
a drink in black hard wine) stops bloody excessive
discharges (in women). Eaten, they help those who feel
gnawing at the stomach, and taken as a drink and eaten
by children they take away the beginnings of stones
[kidney, urinary].  A decoction of as much as fifteen
grains of the black [part] (taken as a drink in honey water
or wine) is good both for suffocation that comes from
nightmares, and for suffocation of the womb and
disorders of the mother [pregnancy]. Peony grows on the 
tops of the highest mountains. 
The herb peony is plucked up in the heat of the dog
days [summer] before sunrise; it is hanged about one and
is good against poisons, bewitching, fears, and devils and
their assaults, and against fevers that come with
shivering whether by night, or day, or paroxysm. And it
is said that (sometimes) growing on a hill where there
were devils, it drove them away.
The male peonie some call orobelium, orobax,
haemagogum, paeseden, menogenion, menion, paeonium,
panthiceratos, idaei dactyli, aglaophotis, theodonium, or
selenion, the Magi call it selenogonon, some, phthisi and the
Romans, casta.

SUGGESTED: Lithospermum, Lithospermum sativum [Fuchs],
Lithospermum majus erectum [Bauhin],
Lithospermum officinale [Linnaeus], Milium solis, 
— Common Gromwell, Pearl Plant 
Some call lithospermon ' Heraclean' because of the
strength of the seed, which is also called lithospermon.
It has leaves similar to those of the olive, but longer,
broader and softer, and those around the bottom lie on
the ground. The small branches are straight, slender, the
thickness of the sharp bulrush, strong, woody. On the
cloven top of them is a springing-out (similar to little
budded stems) with long leaves, among which is a round
white stone seed similar to the little ervum [2-129, 2-131].
It grows in rough eminent places. A decoction of  the seed 
(taken as a drink with white wine) is able to break stones
[kidney, urinary], and expel urine. Some call it
aegonychon, exonychon, leontion, lapis leoninus, gorgonium,
tantalitis, or diosporon, the Romans call it columba, and the
Dacians, gonoleta.
3-159. PHALARIS
SUGGESTED: Phalaris arundinacea, Phalaris canariensis 
— Canary Grass, Phalaris 
Phalaris sends out many little stalks from slender
useless roots — the breadth of two hands, knotty,
similar to reeds, resembling those of zea [Triticum zea], yet
more slender and sweet in taste. The leaves are similar to
those of zea. The white seed is abundant like millet, and
somewhat long. The herb (cut and juiced with water or
wine and so taken as a drink) is able to be effective for
disorders of the bladder and sperm; a spoonful of a
decoction (taken as a drink with water) is good for the
same purposes.

Rubia sylvestris [Fuchs], Rubia sylvestris laevis [Bauhin], 
Gallium molugo — Hedge Bedstraw [Mabberley]
[other usage] Rubia peregrina — Wild Madder 
Some call eruthrodanum 'erythodanon'. The red root is
suitable for dying. Some of it is wild, some sown — as
in Thabana, Galilee and Ravenna, Italy and in Caria —
sown among the olives, like in the fields. It is sown
usefully because much gain is made of it. The stalks of it
are four-cornered, long, rough, similar to those of aparine,
but in every respect bigger and stronger, having the
leaves at distances at every joint lying about like stars in a
circle. The seed is round, at first green, afterwards red,
after that it is ripe, black. The root is thin, long, red, and
diuretic; as a result a decoction (taken as a drink with
honey and water) helps jaundice, sciatica, and paralysis.
It draws out quantities of thick urine, and sometimes also
blood. Those who drink it must be washed every day and
the difference of their voided excrement viewed. A
decoction of the stalk with the leaves (taken as a drink)
helps those bitten by venomous creatures, and a
decoction (taken as a drink with vinegar and honey)
reduces the spleen. The root (inserted as a pessary) is an
abortifacient, and draws out the menstrual flow and
afterbirth. Smeared on with vinegar it cures white
vitiligines [form of leprosy]. The root some call dracons,
some, cinnabar, the Romans, rubia passiva, the Etruscians,
lappa minor , the Egyptians, sophobi, some ereuthodanum,
and it is also called teuthrion.
3-161. LONCHITIS
SUGGESTED: Lonchitis, Polypodium lonchitis, Serapias,
 Aspidium lonchitis — Shield Fern, Holly Fern

Lonchitis has many leaves very similar to leek, yet
broader and somewhat red, broken about towards
the root (and as it were) lying on the ground. It also has a
 532
ROOTS OF AKANTHODA or PRICKLY PLANTS 

few around the stalk, on which are flowers — similar to
little hats in shape (similar to comical persons opening
their mouths wide) — and they are black, but some white
thing arises from them, from opening the mouth wide
towards the lower lip (as it were) a little tongue. The seed
is shut in three-cornered cases shaped like a spearhead,
from which it was thought worthy of its surname. The
root is similar to daucus. It grows in rough, dry places. A
decoction of the root of this (taken as a drink) with wine is 
diuretic. It is also called cestron, or medusa; the Romans
call it venerea, or lanceola. 
3-162. LONCHITIS ETERA
SUGGESTED: Shield Fern, Holly Fern — Lonchitis,
 Polypodium lonchitis, Serapias, Aspidium lonchitis
see 3-161
Lonchitis altera  (also called the rough lonchitis) sends
out leaves similar to scolopendrium [3-121], but
sharper, bigger, and more jagged. A decoction (taken as a
drink with vinegar) is able to cure wounds and remove
inflammation, and it reduces the spleen. The Romans call
it longina, or calabrina.
3-163. ALTHAIA
SUGGESTED: Althaea [Fuchs], Althaea Dioscoridis et Plinii
[Bauhin],  Althaea officinalis [Linnaeus], Bismalva, Hibiscus
— Marsh Mallow, White Mallow 
Althaea is a kind of wild mallow, the downy leaves
round like cyclamen. It has a rose-like flower, the
stalk two feet high, and a clammy root, white within. It is
called althaea for its many properties and various uses.
Boiled in honey and water or wine (or pounded by itself)
it is good for wounds, parotitis [inflamed glands e.g.
mumps], swellings, suppurations, inflamed breasts,
disorders of the perineum, bruises, flatulent tumours,
and distension of the nerves. It dissolves and ripens, or
breaks and brings to a scar. Boiled (as above) and
kneaded together with swines’ grease, goose grease or
turpentine it is good in a pessary for inflammation and
closures of the womb. A decoction of it does the same,
 533
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

also expelling the so-called bodily wastes. A decoction of
the root (taken as a drink with wine) helps dysentery,
pains in the hips, trembling, and those troubled with
hernia; and it soothes toothache, boiled with vinegar and
the mouth washed with it. The seed (either green or dry)
pounded into small pieces and rubbed on with vinegar in 
the sun cleans vitiligines [form of leprosy]. Rubbed on
with oxelaeum [from oxalis or wood sorrel] it prevents hurt 
from poisonous beasts. It is effective against dysentery,
vomiting blood, and excessive discharges from the
bowels. A decoction of the seed (taken as a drink) is good
against bee stings, and those of all small creatures (taken
as a drink in wine or posca [hot drinks]); and the leaves
(with a little oil) are laid on bites and on those who are
burned. The root thickens water (pounded into small
pieces, mixed, and placed out in the open air). It is also
called ibiscus, or althiocon.
3-164. ALKEA
SUGGESTED: Alcea [Fuchs, Brunfels], Alcea vulgaris major
[Bauhin], Malva alcea [Linnaeus] — Hollyhock [Mabberley]
[other usage] Alcea cannabina, Althea cannabina 
— Egyptian Hemp
Alcea is a kind of wild mallow having cut-in leaves
similar to those of the holy herb. It has three or four
stalks, a bark similar to cannabis [3-165], a little flower
similar to a rose, and five or six broad white roots almost a 
foot long. A decoction of these (taken as a drink with
wine or water) cures dysentery and hernias. 
3-165. KANNABIS EMEROS
SUGGESTED: Cannabis sativa [Fuchs, Brunfels, Linnaeus], 
Cannabis gigantea — Hemp
Cannabis is a plant of considerable use in this life for
twisting very strong ropes. It bears leaves with a bad
scent, similar to the ash; long hollow stalks, and a round
seed. Eaten in quantities these quench conception. The
herb (juiced while green) is good for earaches. It is also
called cannabium, schoenostrophon, or asterion; the Romans
call it cannabis.

 Datisca cannabina — Cretan Hemp Plant, Bastard Hemp 
Cannabis sylvestris bears little stems similar to those of
althea [3-163] but darker, sharper and smaller. The
leaves are similar to the cultivated but sharper and
darker. The reddish flowers are similar to lychnis [3-114,
3-115], with the seed and root similar to althea. The root
(boiled and applied) is able to lessen inflammation,
dissolve oedema, and disperse hardened matter around
the joints. The bark of this is suitable for twining ropes. It
is also called hydrastina, the Romans call it terminalis, and
some, cannabis.
3-167. ANAGURIS [ONAGURIS]
SUGGESTED: Anagyris foetida — Bean Clover, Stinking Wood
Anagyris is a shrub similar to a tree, its leaves and
stems very similar to agnus castus  [1-135], with an
extremely strong scent. The flowers are similar to brassica,
the seed in long little horns shaped like kidneys,
variously coloured, solid. They harden when the grapes
ripen. The tender leaves of this (pounded into small
pieces and applied) repress oedema. A teaspoonful is
given to drink in passum [raisin wine] for asthma, as well
as for expulsion of the afterbirth and menstrual flow, and
as an abortifacient. It is given with wine for headaches. It
is hung as an amulet on those who have hard labour [in
giving birth], yet one must at once (after the woman’s
delivery) take off the amulet and put it away. The juice of
the root dissolves and ripens. The seed (eaten)
encourages vomiting excessively. It is also called
anagyros, acopon, or agnacopum.

3-168. KEPAIA
UNKNOWN
Cepea is a succulent similar to portulaca [4-168], yet it
has darker leaves, and a thin root. A decoction of the
leaves (taken as a drink with wine) helps slow painful
urination and those who have a scabbed bladder, and
helps most taken as a drink with a decoction of the roots
of that asparagus called myacanthus. 
3-169. ALISMA
SUGGESTED: Plantago-aquatica, Alisma, Damasonium [Fuchs],
Plantago-aquatica latifolia, Alisma plantago-aquatica  [Linnaeus]
 — Water Plantain, Mad-dog Weed
see 1-11
Alisma has leaves similar to plantain but narrower and 
bending down toward the earth. The stalk is
slender, single, more than a foot high, with little heads
similar to a thyrsus [staff]. The flowers are thin, white, and 
somewhat pale. The roots are like black hellebore — thin,
sweet-smelling, sharp, somewhat thick; it loves watery
places. One or two teaspoonfuls of a decoction of the root
(taken as a drink with wine) is good for those who have
eaten sea hare [2-20], or been bitten by a toad, and those
who have drunk opium [antidote]. It helps griping and
dysentery by itself (or taken as a drink with an equal
amount of daucus seed). It is also good for convulsions,
and disorders of the womb. The herb itself (applied) stops 
discharges of the intestines, expels the menstrual flow,
and soothes oedema. It is also called alcea, damassonium,
acyron, or lyron. 536

 Onobrychis christagalli  — Medick Vetch 
see 3-41
Onobrychis has leaves similar to lens [lentils] but a
little longer, a stalk twenty centimetres long, a
purple flower, and a small root. It grows in moist
undisturbed places. The herb (pounded into small pieces
and smeared on) is able to dissolve tubercles [growths],
and a decoction (taken as a drink with wine) cures slow
painful urination. Rubbed on with oil it encourages
sweating. It is also called onobrochilos, eschasmene,
hypericum, corion, or chamepitys, the Romans call it opaca,
some, brichilata, lopta, or iuncinalis, and the Dacians,
aniassexe.
3-171. UPERIKON
SUGGESTED: Hypericum, Perforata [Fuchs], Hypericum vulgare
[Bauhin], Hypericum perforatum [Linnaeus] 
— Klamath Weed [Mabberley]
Hypericum is a shrub twenty centimetres high, full of
reddish branches, with a yellowish flower that
(crushed with the fingers) yields a bloody juice — which
is why it is called androsemon. It has leaves similar to rue.
The small pods are somewhat rough, long in the
circumference, the size of barley, in which is a black seed
smelling of rosin. It grows in tilled and rough places. It
has a diuretic strength, and inserted as a pessary moves
the menstrual flow. A decoction (taken as a drink with
wine) drives away fevers with paroxysms ocurring every
third or fourth day. A decoction of the seed (taken as a
drink for forty days) cures sciatica. The leaves (applied
together with the seed) heal burns. It is also called
androsemon, corion, or chamepitys, because the seed is
similar in smell to the rosin of pine.

 3-172. ASKURON
SUGGESTED: Ascyrum [Fuchs], Androsaemum hirsutum
[Bauhin], Hypericum hirsutum [Linnaeus]
 Siberian St John’s Wort — Hypericum ascyron
Ascyrum is also a kind of hypericum, differing in size,
bigger in the branches, more full of sprigs, and with
the small leaves appearing a purple colour; it bears
yellow flowers, and fruit (similar to hypericum) smelling
of rosin, and bruised (as it were), staining the fingers with 
blood, so that it is called acrosemon for this. A decoction of
the fruit (taken as a drink with a pint of honey water) is
available for sciatica. It expels much bilious excrement. It
must be given continuously until they are cured.
Smeared on, it is good for burns. It is also called ascyroides,
or acrosemon.
3-173. ANDROSAIMON
SUGGESTED: Androsaeumum [Fuchs],

Androsemum differs from hypericum and from ascyrum
being a shrub of thin branches, full of sprigs. The
little stems are a purple colour, the leaves three times or
four times bigger than rue [3-52, 3-53, 4-98], which send
out a juice similar to wine when bruised. It has many
wings on the top open on each side and feathered,
around which are small little flowers of a yellowish
colour. The seed is in a little cup similar to that of black
poppy (as it were) marked with lines and points. The
filaments yield a rosin-like smell when bruised. Two
teaspoonfuls of the seed of this (pounded into small
pieces and taken in a drink) expel bilious excrement, and
it especially cures sciatica. One must sip water after the
purge. The herb (smeared on) heals burns and stops
blood. It is also called dionysias, or ascyron.

 Coris monspeliensis, Symphytum petraeum [Bedevian] 
— Montpellier Coris 
see 3-88, 4-9
Coris has a leaf similar to erica but smaller, fatter and
red. It is a shrub twenty centimetres high, pleasant-
tasting, sharp, and with a good smell. A decoction of the
seed of this (taken as a drink with wine) induces the
passage of urine and the menstrual flow. A decoction
(taken as a drink with pepper) helps those bitten by
harvest spiders, or with sciatica, tetanus, or chills. Used
with oil it is also an effective ointment for severe spasms.
The root of this (boiled with wine and taken as a drink) is
thought to help those who faint often. It is necessary for
the patient when drinking it to be well covered all over
for it causes the whole body to sweat, and from this one
recovers agility. Some also call this hypericum.
3-175. CHAMAIPITUS
SUGGESTED: Chamaepitys lutea vulgaris [Bauhin],
Teucrium chamaepitys [Linnaeus],  Ajuga chamaepitys [in
Sprague] — Ground Pine, Yellow Bugle
Chamaepitys is a bow-backed herb creeping on the
ground, with leaves similar to the smaller
sempervivum [4-89, 4-90, 4-91], but much thinner, fatter
and rough, thick around the branches, with a smell of
pine. The flowers are thin and yellow, (or white) and the
root is like that of chicory. A decoction of the leaves of this 
(taken as a drink with wine for seven days) cures
jaundice. A decoction (taken as a drink with honey water
for forty days) cures hip pains. It is given (effectively) for
liver complaints, frequent painful urination and
inflamed kidneys, and it is good for griping. In Heraclea,
Pontus they use it as an antidote, giving a decoction to
drink against aconitum [4-77, 4-78]. Polenta (moistened
with a decoction of the herb) is applied for the purposes
mentioned above. Pounded into small pieces with figs
(and given as a pill) it soothes the bowels. Taken with
 539
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

honey, scales aeris [flakes of fish of the air], and rosin it
purges. Applied as a pessary (with honey) it expels things 
from the womb. Smeared on with honey it dissolves hard 
lumps in the breasts, heals wounds, and represses herpes
[viral skin infection]. It is also called pitusorusis, or
orizelon, in Pontus they call it holocyron, or wild bryony,
the Athenians call it ionia, in Euboea it is called sideritis;
the Magi call it sanguis Minervae, the Romans, cupripum,
and the Dacians dochela.

SUGGESTED: Ajuga chia — Chia Bugle
 Ajuga iva, Teucrium iva —  Herb Ivy, Musky Bugle
 Ajuga reptans — Bugle Weed, Common Bugle 
There is also another chamaepitys with branches a foot
long, curved in the shape of an anchor, with thin
sprigs, filaments similar to that above, and a white flower, 
but a black seed. This also smells of pine. There is a third
kind called the male. It is a smooth little herb, with thin
small leaves, white and rough, with a coarse white stalk,
small yellowish flowers, and a little seed with wings. This
also smells of pine. These have a similar strength to that
previously mentioned, yet are not as effective.

HERBS & ROOTS
In the three books before this, best beloved Areius, I
have spoken of aromatic matters, oils, ointments, trees,
living creatures, cereals, vegetables, roots, juices, herbs
and seeds. In this the fourth book we will discuss herbs
and roots not previously mentioned.
4-1. KESTRON
SUGGESTED: Betonica [Fuchs], Betonica purpurea [Bauhin],
 Betonica officinalis [Linnaeus], Stachys officinalis [in Sprague],
Stachys betonica — Betony, Woundwort, Bishop’s Wort,
 Hedge Nettle, Windflower
[other usage] Cestrum nocturnum — Night Jasmine
Cestron is a herb with a thin four-cornered stalk the
height of a foot or more, the leaves long, soft, similar
to the oak, jagged all around, smelling well. They are
bigger towards the root, and on the top of the stalks lies
the seed encased in an ear like thymbra [3-45]. They ought
to dry the leaves after gathering, as there is the most use
of these. The roots underneath are thin like hellebore. A
drink of a decoction of these (with honey water)
encourages vomit, throwing up phlegmy stuff. A
decoction of a teaspoonful of the leaves is taken as a drink 
with honey water for convulsions, hernia, disorders of
the womb, and womb constriction.  Three teaspoonfuls
are given with a pint of wine to those bitten by venomous 
creatures. The herb (applied) helps those bitten by
venomous creatures, and a teaspoonful of a decoction
(taken as a drink with wine) helps against deadly poisons
[antidote]. If anyone drinks it (beforehand) he shall not
be hurt, although he takes a deadly medicine. It is also
urinary, and draws out the menstrual flow. Four
teaspoonfuls of a decoction (taken as a drink with ten
cups of honey water) purge. It is good with honey for
tuberculosis of the lungs, and for spitting up pus, but the
leaves must be dried, pounded into small pieces, and
stored in a ceramic jar. It is called psychotrophon because it
is found in the coldest places. The Romans call it vetonica,
or rosmarinus.

Caryophyllus sylvestris vulgaris latifolius [Bauhin],
Dianthus carthusianorum [Linnaeus] — Carthusian Pink
 Betonica coronaria, Dianthus caryophyllus, 
Caryophyllus domesticus — Carnation, Picotee, Clove Pink
Betonica, britannica, or vettonica is an herb with leaves
similar to lapathum sylvestre [2-140] but darker, with
more filaments, and astringent to the taste. It sends out a
stalk that is not great, and a short thin root. The leaves are
juiced and thickened by stirring in the sun or over a fire.
It is astringent — suitable for gangrenous ulceration in
the mouth and tonsils. It is available for everything else
that needs an astringent. Betony grows in meadows and
hilly, clean, mild places around shrubs. It preserves both
the souls and bodies of men. It is effective against
night-walking, harmful places, and difficult sleep; and it
is recommended for all types of cures. It has a root all red,
and with a good scent. The leaves are like leek, the
middle of the leaves is a reddish colour, and they are
three-cornered into an upright stalk. On them are purple
flowers. The strength of it is as follows. Bruised when it is
new and applied to the wound of a broken head it makes
it painless. It heals wounds and extracts broken bones. It
does this if changed every day until it is healed. Boiled
with water and applied with hot cloths, or rubbed
around the temples with bitumen it heals headaches. The 
smoke of the root is also inhaled for them.

SUGGESTED: Lysimachia purpurea [Fuchs], Epilobium hirsutum
[Linnaeus] — Apple Pie, Codlins and Cream 
Lysimachia lutea [Fuchs], Lysimachia vulgaris [Linnaeus] 
— Common Yellow Loosestrife 
see 4-118
Lysimachia sends out thin stalks a foot high (or even
higher) at the joints of which thin leaves emerge,
similar to those of the willow, astringent to the taste. The
flowers are red or a golden colour. It grows in marshy
places and near water. The juice of the leaves is

Lysimachia lutea
from FUCHS — 1545

astringent, and a liquid medicine of it, enema, or
suppository, is good for throwing-up blood and
dysentery. In a pessary it stops women’s excessive
menstrual discharges. The herb is effective stuffed in the
nostrils for flows of blood. It is also a wound herb and
staunches blood. The smoke (inhaled) has very sharp
fumes so that it both drives away snakes, and kills flies. It
is also called lytron.
4-4. POLUGONON ARREN
SUGGESTED: Polygonum-mas [Fuchs], Polygonum latifolium
[Bauhin], Polygonum aviculare [Linnaeus] — Knotgrass,
Centinode, Knotweed, Armstrong
medicinal, food
The male polygonon is a tender herb with many slender 
branches surrounded with joints, creeping along the
earth like grass, the leaves similar to those of rue [3-52,
3-53, 4-98] but somewhat longer and softer. It has seed by
every leaf, which is why it is called the male. The flower is 
white or purple. 
The juice (taken as a drink) is astringent and cooling.
It is effective for bloodspitters, discharges from the
intestines, biliousness, and slow painful urination. It also
evidently causes an urge to urinate, and taken as a drink
with wine it helps those bitten by venomous creatures.
Taken one hour before the fit it helps the circuits of acute
fevers. It stops women's excessive menstrual discharges
used as a pessary, and dropped in the ears it is good for
ear sores and their pus. Boiled with wine (and also
adding honey) it is excellent for ulcers on the genitals.
The leaves are applied for burning of the stomach,
throwing-up blood, for herpes [ viral skin infection],
erysipela [streptococcal skin infection], inflammation, and
fresh wounds. It is also called polygonaton, cynochalem,
herculea, asphalton, chiliophullon, clema, polycarpon,
carcinethron, peuthalida, myrtopetalon, cnopodion, zarithea, or 
pedalion. The Egyptians call it thephin, some, stemphin, the
Magi, genitura herois , some, unguis muris , the Romans,
seminalis, some, stopinaca, and the Africans, chulum.

4-5. POLUGONON THELU
SUGGESTED: Polygonum amphibium — Amphibious Persicaria
 Polygonum  hydropiper — Persicaria, Water Pepper
The female polygonon is a little shrub with one stalk,
tender, similar to a reed, with continuous joints lying
on one another like a trumpet, and all around the joints
there are small leaves similar to those of the pine. The
root is of no use. It grows in watery places. It is astringent
and cooling, doing the same things as that above because
it is not weaker. The Romans call it seminalis.
4-6. POLUGONATON
SUGGESTED: Polygonatum latifolium [Fuchs],
 Polygonatum multiflorum [in Sprague] — Solomon’s Seal
Polygonatum angustifolium [Fuchs], Convallaria verticillata
[Linnaeus], Polygonatum verticillatum [in Sprague],
 Polygonatum officinale, Polygonatum vulgare, Polygonatum,
Convallaria polygonatum, Sigillium salomonis 
— Solomon’s Seal, Sealwort
Polygonatum grows on hills, a shrub higher than a foot,
with leaves similar to laurel but broader and
smoother, somewhat similar in taste to a quince or
pomegranate, for it tastes astringent. At every emerging
of the leaves are white flowers in a larger quantity than
the leaves, the number to be reckoned from the root. It
has a white root — soft, long, with many thick joints,
strongly scented, the thickness of a finger — good
applied on wounds, and to take away spots on the face.
4-7a. KLEMATIS
SUGGESTED: Clematis daphnoides [Fuchs, Bauhin], 
Vinca minor [Linnaeus] — Running Myrtle, Periwinkle 
Clematis grows in good soil. It has small vinelike
branches, as much as the thickness of juncus [4-52,
1-16], and a little leaf similar to laurel both in shape and
colour, but much smaller. A decoction of the leaves and
the stalks of this (taken as a drink with wine) lessen
excessive discharges of the bowels and dysentery.

Clematis daphnoides
from FUCHS — 1545

Applied in a pessary with milk and rosaceum [1-53] (or
cyprinum  [1-65]) it cures pains of the womb. Chewed, it
eases toothache; applied, it helps those bitten by
venomous creatures. It is said that a decoction (taken as a
drink with vinegar) helps those bitten by snakes. It grows 
in untilled ground. It is also called daphnoides, myrsinoides, 
polygonoides, or philetaerium.
4-7b. KLEMATIS ETERA
SUGGESTED: Clematis cirrhosa — Evergreen Clematis
 Clematis angustifolia —Virgin's Bower
Clematis alpina — Alpine Clematis 
 POISONOUS
There is another clematis which sends out a vinelike
branch, reddish, flexible; the leaf extremely sharp to
the taste and ulcerating. It winds around trees like smilax
[4-144, 4-145]. The seed of this (pounded into small pieces
and taken as a drink with water or honey water) drives
phlegm and bile downward. The leaves (applied as a
poultice) drive away leprosy. They are preserved with
lepidium [2-205] to eat with meat [ vegetable]. It is also
called epigetis, the Egyptians call it phylacuum, and the
Romans, ambuxus.
4-8. POLEMONION
SUGGESTED: Polemonium caeruleum — Charity,
 Jacob’s Ladder, Greek Valerian 
Polemonia has thin little winged branches, with leaves
a little bigger than rue [3-52, 3-53, 4-98], but longer
like those of polygonum [4-4, 4-5] or calamint. On the top
of them is what looks like clusters of berries, in which are
black seeds. The root is a foot long, whitish, similar to
struthium [2-193]. It grows in hilly, rough places.The root
of this is taken as a drink in wine against venomous
creatures, and with water for dysentery, painful
urination, and sciatica. A teaspoonful with vinegar is
given for the spleen. The root of this is carried around one 
to prevent scorpions striking. They say that those who
have this shall not be bitten, and though they are touched 
 551
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

yet nothing will happen. Chewed, it eases toothaches. It
is also called philetaeria, while the Cappadocians call it
chiliodynamis. 
4-9. SUMPHUTON PETRAION
SUGGESTED: Coris monspeliensis, Symphytum petraeum  
— Montpellier Coris 
see 3-174
Symphitum Petraeum  grows on rocks. It has little
branches similar to origanum, thin leaves, and little
heads like thyme. The whole plant is woody and has a
sweet smell, is sweet to the taste, and causes spittle. It has
a long, faint purple root almost the thickness of a finger.
This (boiled with honey and water and taken as a drink)
gets up vile stuff from the lungs. It is given with water to
those who spit up blood, and for inflammation in the
kidneys. Boiled with wine it is taken (as a drink) for
dysentery, and women's excessive bloody menstrual
discharges. It is boiled with vinegar and honey for
convulsions and hernias; and chewed it quenches thirst. 
Used as a poultice it is good for the roughness of a sore
throat, heals new wounds, and represses vaginal hernias. 
It also joins together broken flesh.
4-10. SUMPHUTON ALLO
SUGGESTED: Symphytum-magnum, Consolida maior [Fuchs],
Symphytum  consolida major [Bauhin], 
Symphytum officinale [Linnaeus] — Comfrey, Knitbone
Symphyton alterum sends out a stalk two feet high or
more — light, thick, angular, empty, similar to that of
sonchus [2-159] — around which comes (from not great
distances) rough narrow leaves, somewhat long, similar
to those of bugloss [4-128, 4-23 to 4-27]. The stalk has
some extensions of slender leaves adhering to it,
stretching along at the corners. From every wing are
yellowish flowers standing up, and the seed is around
the stalk like verbascum [4-104]. The whole stalk and
leaves have a somewhat prickly down that causes itching
if touched. The roots are underneath — to the outward
appearance black, but within white and slimy — of which

use is made. Pounded into small pieces (and taken in a
drink) they are good for bloodspitters and hernias.
Applied, they close up new wounds. Boiled, they join
pieces of flesh together. They are smeared on for
inflammations — most usefully for those in the perineum 
— with the leaves of senecio [4-123]. It is also called pecton,
while the Romans call it solidago.
4-11. OLESTION
SUGGESTED: Holosteum umbellatum — Holosteum, Chickweed, 
Jagged Chickweed, Umbellate Stitchwort
Holostium is a little herb about three or four fingers
above the ground. It has astringent leaves, and
tendrils like those of coronopus [2-158] or grass; a very thin 
root, similar to filaments, white to see, the thickness of
four fingers. It grows on hills. Boiled, this can also join
pieces of flesh together, and it is given (as a drink with
wine) for hernias. 
4-12. STOIBE
SUGGESTED: Stobaea pinnata [Loudon] 
— Carthmus-like Stobaea
 Stipa pennata, Stipa barbata — Feather Grass, Stipa
 Stipa tenacissima, Macrochloa tenacissima — Alfa, Esparto
Stoebe is well known. The seed and the leaves are
astringent, so a decoction of them is given as a
suppository for dysentery, and it is dropped into
purulent ears. The leaves are applied to help bloodshot
eyes caused by a stroke, and they stop excessive bloody
discharges. It is also called tobion, while the Romans call it
stupa. 
4-13. KLUMENON
UNKNOWN 
Clymenon sends out a foursquare stalk similar to that
of the bean, and leaves similar to those of plantain. It 
has little pods on the stalk (nodding together) similar to
iris and the curled tufts of the polypus. That on the hills is
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK
 555

the best. It is all juiced together with the root. The juice
(taken as a drink) is good for throwing-up blood, for
abdominal cavities, and for excessive bloody discharges.
It is astringent and cooling, and it stops flows of blood
that come out of the nostrils. The leaves or the pods,
pounded into small pieces and applied to new wounds,
bring them effectively to a scar. It is also called
calycanthemom, periclymenon, helyophthes, hepatitis, smilax,
anatolicon, dyticon, or merginem; the Romans call it
volucrum, or volucrum maius ; the Egyptians call it oxiui,
clymenon, or clumenion, and they also call it agonon.
4-14. PERIKLUMENON
SUGGESTED: Periclymenus, Caprifolium [Fuchs], Periclymenum,
Lonicera periclymenum [Linnaeus], Mater silvana, 
Lonicera caprifolium — Common Honeysuckle, Woodbine,
Perfoliate Honeysuckle, Caprifoly 
Periclymenon is a single little shrub with small whitish
leaves circling it at distances similar to cissus [2-210],
and by the leaves’ emergence are seeds similar to cissus.
On top is a white flower similar to the bean, a somewhat
round hard seed (in a way) lying on the leaf and hard to
pluck out; the root is thick and round. It grows in fields
and hedges and winds itself around the neighbouring
shrubs. The seed of this is gathered when it is ripe and
dried in the shade. A teaspoonful (taken in a drink for
forty days) reduces the spleen, dissolves weariness, and
is good for difficult breathing and the hiccups. After the
sixth day it makes one urinate blood. It is also birth
hastening, and the leaves have the same strength. A
decoction (taken as a drink for thirty seven days) is said to 
make men unfit for generation [ birth control]. Rubbed
(with oil) on those who have fever fits that recur, it drives
away the shivering. It is also called  aegine, clymenon,
carpathum, splenium, hepatitis, helxine major, clematitis,
myrsine, or calycanthemon; the Magi call it poliom veneris,
the Egyptians, turcum, the Romans, volucrum majus, and
the Africans, lanath.

4-15a. TRIBOLOS ENUDROS
SUGGESTED: Tribulus terrestris — Caltrops, Land Caltrops 
Trapa natans — Water Caltrops
Tribulus has two types: the land kind has similar
leaves to portulaca [4-168] yet they are thin. The
vinelike branches are long, with stiff hard prickles on
them, and scattered on the ground. It grows near rivers
and in courtyards of houses. There is another kind found
in the water — which is also called bucephalus, or
tauroceros, or by the Romans, tribulus aquaticus — growing 
in rivers, with the hair standing above but hiding the
prickle. The leaves are broad with a long stem, but the
stalk is thick at the top rather than in the bottom. On it
there are also certain hairy abnormal growths similar to
ears; the fruit is hard like that of the other. They are both
astringent and cooling, and are poultices for all
inflammation. With honey they heal thrush [candidiasis], 
the tonsils, and rotten ulcers of the mouth and gums.
They are juiced for eye medicines. The seed (taken in a
drink when it is new) helps stones [urinary, kidney]. A
teaspoonful of the land kind (taken in a drink and
applied as well) recovers those bitten by vipers. It is good
against poisons (taken in a drink with wine) and a
decoction of it (sprinkled) kills fleas. The Thracians living
by the river Strymon fatten horses with the green herb,
but the seed, sweet and nourishing, they take for food,
using it instead of bread.   
4-15b. SAXIPHRAGON 
SUGGESTED: Saxifraga, Ruta-muraria [Fuchs], Saxifragum,
Empetrum [Brunfels], Ruta muraria [Bauhin], 
Asplenium Ruta-muraria [Linnaeus] — Wall Rue
[other usage] Saxifraga cymbalaria  — Saxifrage, Rockfoil
Saxifragum is a shrub (similar to epithymon)growing on
rocks and in rough places. The herb (boiled with
wine) is helpful in cases of slow painful urination when
there is no fever, but it is given with warm water while
the fever lasts. It also cures stones in the bladder and
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK
 559
Tribulus terrestris

encourages the urine. It is also called saxifrangum,
empetrum, scolopendrium, or bruchum, while the Romans
call it saxifraga, or sanaria.
4-16. LEIMONION
SUGGESTED: Limonium, Pyrola [Fuchs], 
Pyrola rotundifolia major [Bauhin], 
Pyrola rotundifolia [Linnaeus] — Wintergreen
[other usage] Statice limonium, Limonium vulgare,
Statice maritima  — Sea Lavender, Wild Marsh Beet
Limonium has ten or more leaves similar to beet yet
thinner and smaller, and a thin upright stalk equal
(as it were) to the lily, full of red seed, astringent to the
taste. An acetabulum [vinegar cruet] of the seed (pounded
into small pieces and taken in a drink with wine) is able to 
help dysentery and abdominal cavities, and stop
women's excessive bloody menstrual discharges. It grows 
in fields. It is also called neuroides, potamogeton, lonchitis, or 
rapronium; the Mysians call it  mendruta, the Syrians,
meuda, also, lycosemphyllon, helleborosemata, or scyllion; the
Magi call it cor lupi, the Romans, veratrum nigrum, some,
tintinabulum terrae, the Gauls, iumbarum, and the Dacians,
dacina.
4-17. LAGOPOUS
SUGGESTED: Lagopus, Leporinus pes, Trifolium humile [Fuchs],
Trifolium arvense [Linnaeus] — Field Clover, Hare’s Foot 
[other usage] Filago lagopus — Cotton Rose, Hare’s Foot 
Lagopus is restrictive to the intestines if a decoction is
taken as a drink with wine (but for those with a fever
with water). It is also hanged about one for inflammation
of the groin. It grows in the ranks of corn. It is also called
cuminum leporis.

SUGGESTED: Campanula medium — Canterbury Bells,
 Mercury's Violet 
 Campanula cichoracea — Headed Bell Flower 
 Medium alpinum, Campanula laciniata — Bell Flower, Harebell
Medium grows in shady rocky places. It has leaves
similar to seris [2-160], a great stalk of three feet,
round purple-coloured flowers, and small seed similar to
cnicus [4-119, 4-190]. The root is twenty centimetres long,
the thickness of a staff, bitter to the taste. Pounded into
small pieces when it is dry and licked in with honey that
has been boiled for several days, it stops excessive bloody
discharges. A decoction of the seed (taken as a drink with
wine) draws out the menstrual flow. It is also called
medica, trifolium, clemation, osmos, trigonos, cybellium, or
polyphyllon; the Romans call it trifolium odoratum, and the
Egyptians, epaphou. 
4-19. EPIMEDION 
SUGGESTED: Epimedium alpinum — Barrenwort, Bishop's Hat
Epimedium has a stalk that is not great, with about ten
or twelve leaves similar to cissus, (but it bears neither
seed nor flowers); the roots are thin, black, strongly-
scented and unsavoury to the taste. It grows in watery
places. The leaves (pounded into small pieces with oil)
make a poultice for the breasts so that they do not swell.
The root causes barrenness. Three teaspoonfuls of the
leaves pounded into small pieces, and taken as a drink in
wine for three days after the menstrual flow purgation,
keeps women from conception [birth control]. It is also
called erineos, thrias, or polyrrhizon, while the Romans call
it vindicta.
4-20. XIPHION
SUGGESTED: Gladiolus illyricus — Gladiole, Sword Lily
 Gladiolus communis, Gladiolus byzantinus —  Sword Lily
Xiphion is called phasganon because the shape of the
leaf is similar to that of iris, yet smaller, narrower,
 563
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

pointed like a little sword, and fibrous. It sends forth a
stalk a foot long, on which are purple flowers distant
from one another by steps, round seed, and two roots —
one of them resting on the other — similar to little
scallions. That which lies underneath is slender but that
above, fuller. It grows (especially) in fields. The root that
is on top  (applied with wine and frankincense) is able to
draw out prickles and splinters, and (with meal of lolium
[2-116, 4-140] and honey water) to dissolve the pannus
[opaque thickening of cornea with veins]. It is mixed with 
similar plasters, and used for a pessary it draws out the
menstrual flow. They say that a decoction of the upper
root (taken as a drink with wine) encourages sexual
intercourse [aphrodisiac]; but that the lowest make them
without lust [ anaphrodisiac], and that the upper root is
effective given to children that are broken [? foreskin or
hymen] in a liquid medicine with water. It is also called
machaeronion, anactorion, or arion; the Romans call it
gladiolus, and some, genitalis.
4-21. SPARGANION
SUGGESTED: Sparganium simplex — Reed Grass, Bur Reed
 Sparganium erectum, Sparganium ramosum 
 — Branched Bur Reed 
Sparganium has leaves similar to a little sword but
narrower and bending downward more, and on the
top of the stalk are little balls in which is the seed. The
root and seed are given with wine to those bitten by
venomous creatures. It is also called xiphidion, or bolon.
4-22. XURIS
SUGGESTED: Xyris indica, Xyris congensis, Xyris capensis 
— Xyris
Xyris has leaves similar to iris but broader and sharp at
the top, with a stalk breaking out of the middle of the 
leaves — thick enough, one-foot long — on which are
triangular pods. On them is a purple flower, and in the
middle it is a Phoenician colour [red]. The seed (in little
cases) is similar to beans — round, red and sharp. The
long red root has many joints, and is good for wounds in

the head and fractures; and mixed with one third part
flour of brass [zinc oxide], a fifth part of the root of
centaury and sufficient honey, it extracts prickles and all
sorts of weapons without pain. Applied with vinegar it
cures oedema and inflammation. The root (bruised with
passum [raisin wine]) is taken as a drink for convulsion,
hernia, sciatica, slow painful urination, and intestinal
discharges. Thirty grains of a decoction of the seed (taken
as a drink in wine) is most uretical. If a decoction is taken
as a drink with vinegar, it also reduces the spleen. It is
also called iris agria, or cactos, the Romans call it gladiolus,
some call it iris agrestis, while the Dacians call it aprus. 
4-23. ANCHOUSA
SUGGESTED: Anchusa aggregata — Cluster-flowered Bugloss 
 Anchusa azurea, Anchusa italica, Anchusa paniculata,

 Alkanna tinctoria, Anchusa tinctoria, Lithospermum tinctorium 
— Alkanet, Dyer’s Bugloss or Spanish Bugloss 
see 4-24, 4-119, 4-128
Anchusa has many prickly leaves (similar to the sharp-
leaved lettuce) — rough, sharp and black — on
every side of the root joining to the earth. The root is the
thickness of a finger, and the colour almost of blood. In
the summer it becomes astringent, dyeing the hands. It
grows in good grounds. The root has an astringent
nature: good (boiled in wax and oil) for burns and old
ulcers. Applied with polenta it cures erysipela
[streptococcal skin infection], vitiligines [form of leprosy];
and smeared on with vinegar it cures leprosy. Given as a
pessary it is an abortifacient. A decoction of it is given for
jaundice and inflamed kidneys, and it is given to the
splenetic (if they have a fever) with honey and water. A
decoction of the leaves (taken as a drink with wine) stops
discharges of the bowels. The ointment makers use the
root for thickening ointments. It is also called calyx,
onoclea, catanchusa, lybica, archibellion, onophyllon,
porphyris, mydusa, salyx, or nonea, while the Africans call it
buinesath.

SUGGESTED: see 4-23, 4-128
Anchusa altera differs from the above in having smaller 
leaves yet equally sharp. There are thin little
branches, with flowers of a purple colour drawing
towards a Phoenician [red]. The roots are red and very
long. Around harvest time they have something similar
to blood in them. It grows in sandy places. The root and
leaves are able to help those bitten by venomous
creatures — especially the viper-bitten — eaten, taken as
a drink, or hanged about one. Chewed and spat out into
the mouth of a venomous beast, it will kill him. It is also
called alcibiadian, or onocheiles.
4-25. ANCHOUSA ETERA
SUGGESTED: see 4-128
There is also another similar to the above, but with a
smaller seed of a Phoenician [red] colour. Chewed
and spat out into the mouth of a snake, it will kill him. An
acetabulum [vinegar cruet] of a decoction the root (taken
as a drink with hyssop [3-30] and nasturtium [2-185])
draws out broadworms. 
4-26. LUKOPSIS
SUGGESTED: Lycopsis arvensis, Anchusa arvensis 
— Field Bugloss see 4-27
Lycopsis has leaves similar to lettuce — but longer,
thicker, sharp and broader — lying down around the 
head of the root. It sends out a long, straight, rough stalk
with many prickly shoots a foot long, and on them little
flowers, almost a purple. The root is red and astringent. It
grows in level fields. The root (applied with oil) heals
wounds, and with polenta it heals erysipela [streptococcal
skin infection]. Pounded into small pieces and rubbed on
with oil it reduces sweating. This is also called anchusa.

Echium germanicum spinosum [Fuchs],
 Buglossum sylvestre minus [Bauhin], Lycopsis arvensis
[Linnaeus] — Anchusa, Bugloss
 
[other usage] Echium plantagineum — Purple Viper's Bugloss
Echion has long, sharp, somewhat thin leaves similar to 
those of anchusa [4-23 to 4-26], but smaller and fat,
with thin little prickles lying on them, similar to those
which make leaves rough. There are many thin little
stalks, and on either side thin little black leaves spread
abroad (similar to wings), smaller as they grow nearer to
the top of the stalk. The flowers by the leaves are a purple
colour, in which is the seed, similar to the head of a viper.
The root is thinner than a finger, somewhat black, a
decoction of which (taken as a drink with wine) not only
helps those already bitten by snakes, but also makes
those who drink it beforehand unbitten. Both the leaves
and the seed are of similar use. Taken with wine or some
other sipping it lessens the pain of the loins [digestive or
procreative]. It is also called aridan, or alcibiadion, while
the Romans call it alcibiacum [halicacabum — a bad poison].

see 3-50, 3-109, 4-28, 4-176
Ocimoides has leaves similar to basil, and rough
branches twenty centimetres long, with pods
similar to hyoscyamus [4-69] full of black seed similar to
melanthium [3-93]. A decoction of the seed (taken as a
drink in wine) is able to cure the viper-bitten and the bites 
of other snakes. It is also given with myrrh [1-77, 1-73,
4-116] and pepper for sciatica. The root that lies
underneath is thin and useless. It is also called
philetaerium, echion, scorpiuron, sparganon, althaea,

amaranthis, probataea, elaphion, antimimon, porphyris,
augion, nemesion, hyaenopsolon, thersites, thermutis, or
misopathos, while the Romans call it ocimastrum. 
4-29. ERINOS
SUGGESTED: Erinus hispanicus, Erinus alpinus [Bedevian] 
— Erinus, Liver Balsam
Erinus grows by rivers and fountains and has leaves
similar to those of basil yet smaller and jagged at the
upper parts; with five or six little branches twenty
centimeters long, white flowers, and a little black seed
with an unpleasant taste. The stalk is full of liquid and so
are the leaves. Two teaspoonfuls of the seed (mixed with
four of honey and smeared on) stop discharges of the
eyes; and the juice soothes earache (dropped in the ears
with sulphur that never felt the fire and saltpetre
[potassium nitrate]). It is also called ocimoides, or hydrero,
while the Romans call it basil.
4-30. AGROSTIS
SUGGESTED: Gramen [Fuchs], Stellaria holostea [Linnaeus], 
Caryophyllus arvensis glaber flore majore [Bauhin],
— Greater Stitchwort [Mabberley]
[other usage] Agrostis alba, Agrostis palustris 
— White Bent Grass, Fiorin Grass
Agrostis has little branches full of joints creeping on
the earth and growing out from the stalks; sweet,
knotty roots, the sharp leaves hard and broad like a little
reed, nourishing for cows and labouring cattle. The root
of this (pounded into small pieces) is applied to heal
wounds. A decoction of it (taken as a drink) is good for
griping, painful urination, and ulcers around the
bladder, and it breaks urinary stones. It is also called
aegicon, or amaxitist; the Egyptians say anuphi, the
Romans, gramen, some say assefolium, sanguinalis, or
uniola, the Spaniards, aparia, the Dacians, cotiata, and the
Africans, jebal.

SUGGESTED: Calamagrostis arenaria — Sea Sand Reed 
 Phragmites australis, Phragmites communis — Common Reed
Reed grass is bigger in every respect than gramen, but
eaten, it is a killer of labouring beasts (especially that
which grows in Babylon by the wayside).
4-32. AGROSTIS EN PARNASSO
SUGGESTED: Parnassia palustris — Grass of Parnassus
The grass that grows on Parnassus is more full of
stems. It bears leaves similar to cissus [2-210], a white
flower, and has a sweet scent, a small seed, and five or six
effective roots of a finger's thickness — white, soft,
strong. The juice of this (boiled with wine, as much
honey, an half part of myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116], pepper,
and a third part of frankincense) is an excellent medicine
for the eyes. It is stored in a brass box. A decoction of the
roots is good for the same disorders. The seed is strongly
diuretic, and stops vomits and flowing bowels. That
which grows in Cilicia (which the inhabitants call cinna)
inflames rude beasts if often fed on when it is moist. 
4-33. SIDERITIS
SUGGESTED: Sideritis-prima [Fuchs],
Sideritis vulgaris hirsuta erecta [Bauhin], 
Betonica annua var hirsuta, Stachys recta [Linnaeus], 
Stachys procumbens,  Stachys sideritis — Mountain Woundwort
Sideritis is a herb with leaves similar to marrubium [3-38] 
but longer, similar to those of sage or oak, yet smaller
and sharp. It sends out foursquare stalks twenty
centimetres long or rather more — not unpleasant to the
taste, and somewhat gently astringent — on which are
round whorls at distances apart (similar to marrubium),
and in them is black seed. It grows in places under rocks.
The leaves (applied) are able to close open cuts and sore
wounds, and reduce inflammation. It is also called
Heraclea, the Magi call it genitura, some say the blood of
Titan, or the tail of a scorpion; Pythagoras says parmiron,

Acreas, xanthophanes; Osthenes says buphthalmum, the
Egyptians, sendionor, the Romans, vertumnus, some,
solaster, and the Africans, asterchillos.
4-34. SIDERITIS ETERA
SUGGESTED: Stachys arvensis [Mabberley] — Stagger-weed 
The other sideritis has slender branches of two feet,
and leaves on long stems (similar to those of fern)
with many in-cuts towards the top on either side, and
from the upper wings long thin shoots with a rough head 
on the top, round like a sphere, in which is the seed —
similar to beet but rounder and harder. This (with the
leaves) is good for wounds. 
4-35. SIDERITIS TRITE
SUGGESTED: Stachys sylvatica — Hedge Woundwort
There is said to be yet another sideritis (which Crateuas 
calls heraclea) growing in walls and vineyards, with
many leaves from one root, similar to coriander, smooth
tender little stalks about twenty centimetres long,
somewhat white and ruddy; the little flowers of a
Phoenician [red] colour, bitter to the taste, clammy — and 
the strength of this (applied) is that it congeals bleeding
and new wounds.
4-36. ACHILLEIOS 
SUGGESTED: Achillea ageratum — Milfoil, Sweet Maudlin
 Achillea atrata — Black Milfoil 
 Achillea fragrantissima, Santolina fragrantissima
 — Lavender Cotton
Achillea is also called achillea sideritis . It bears small
rods a hand’s width long (or rather more) in the
shape of spindles, and about them thin little leaves
having frequent in-cuts across like coriander —
somewhat red, clammy, smelling considerably, not
unpleasant but having a medicinal smell. There is a
round tuft on the top; the flowers white, resembling gold. 
It grows in fertile places. The fibres of this (pounded)

congeals bloody wounds, reduces inflammation, and
stops bleeding, as also of that of the womb (in a pessary);
and a decoction of this is a douche for the excessive
menstrual flows of women. It is also drunk for dysentery.
Some call it myriomorphon, chiliophyllon, stratioticon, or
Heracleon, the Romans, supercilium veneris;  some call it
acorus sylvaticus, militaris, or millefolium, and the Africans
call it asterchillos.
4-37. BATOS
SUGGESTED: Rubus [Fuchs], Rubus vulgaris, 
Rubus fructu nigro [Bauhin], Rubus fructiosus [Linnaeus], 
Rubus plicatus — Blackberry, Common Bramble 
Batus (with which we are familiar) binds and dries,
and it dyes the hair. A decoction of the tops of it (as a
drink) stops the flows of the intestines, restrains the
excessive menstrual flows of women, and is convenient
for the bites of the prester [mythological snake]. The
leaves are chewed to strengthen the gums and heal apthae 
[aptylia — absence of saliva]. The leaves (applied)
restrain herpes [viral skin infection], heal running ulcers
on the head, drooping eyes, venereal warts, and
haemorrhoids. Pounded into small pieces and applied,
they are available for gastritis and heart conditions. The
juice from the bruised stalks and leaves stirred in the sun
does better for all the purposes previously mentioned.
The juice of the thoroughly ripe fruit is good put into oral
medicines. Eaten when it is half-ripe, it also stops
discharges of the intestines. The flowers of it (as a drink
with wine) also stop the bowels. It is also called cynosbatos, 
selinorition, or asyntrophon. The Magi say sanguis Titani ,
some, sanguis ibis, the Romans, sentis, some, rubus, or mora 
vaticana, the Dacians, mantia, the Egyptians, haemceos, and 
some, ametros.
4-38. BATOS IDAIA
SUGGESTED: Rubus idaeus — Red Raspberry
It is called rubus idaeus because it grows abundantly in
Ida — but it is much more tender than that above, with
little prickles, and it is also found without prickles. It does
 579
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK
Rubus idaeus
after FAGUET — 1888 

the same things as that mentioned above, and
furthermore the flower (pounded into small pieces with
honey and rubbed on) helps eye inflammation, and
extinguishes erysipela [streptococcal skin infection]. It is
given in a drink with water for gastritis.
4-39. ELXINE KUSSAMPELOS
SUGGESTED: Helxine-cissampelos, Convolvulus, 
Volubilis media [Fuchs], Convolvulus minor arvensis [Bauhin], 
Convolvulus arvensis [Linnaeus] — Common Bindweed
Helxine has leaves similar to cissus but smaller, with
long little branches clasping around wherever it
occurs. It grows in hedges, vineyards and corn. The juice
of the leaves (taken as a drink) has a laxative effect on the
bowels. It is also called elitis, canochersaea, amelxine, eusine,
amorgine, sucotachos, psychuacos, melampelon, cissampelon,
cissamethon, or analetamenon, the Romans call it volutum
laparou, and the Egyptians, hapap. 
4-40. ELATINE
SUGGESTED: Antirrhinum elatine, Linaria elatine, 
Cymbalaria elatine — Elatine, Cancerwort, 
Pointed-leaved Toadflax
 Elatine hydropiper — Water Pepper, Waterwort, Pipewort
Elatine has leaves similar to helxine [above] but smaller,
rounder, and hairy. The five or six branches are thin,
twenty centimetres long from the root, full of leaves that
are sharp to the taste. It grows among corn and in tilled
places. The leaves (applied with polenta) are able to help
inflamed rheumatic eyes. Boiled and sipped it stops
dysentery.  580

Eupatorium veterum [Bauhin], Agrimonia eupatoria [Linnaeus]
— Agrimony, Cocklebur, Liverwort, Sticklewort 
[other usage] Eupatorium syriacum — Syrian Eupatorium
 Eupatorium cannabinum — Hemp Agrimony
Eupatorium is an herb like a shrub placing out one stem 
— thin, woody, straight, black and rough — half a
metre long or rather more, and the leaves jagged (at
distances) most commonly into five parts (or rather more, 
similar to those of quinquefolium or even cannabis), and
those inclining to black, cut-in on the edges like a saw.
The seed grows all around from the middle of the stalk,
somewhat rough, bending downward so that dried it
sticks to clothes. The leaves of this (pounded fine and
applied with old swines’ grease) heal difficult scars on
ulcers. The seed and herb (taken as a drink with wine)
help dysentery and serpent bites. Some were deceived
and called this artemisia, for it is diverse (as we have
shown). It is also called hepatorium, or hepatitis, while the
Romans call it volucrum maius.
4-42. PENTAPHULLON
SUGGESTED: Quinquefolium maius candidum [Fuchs],
Quinquefolium album majus alterum [Bauhin], Potentilla alba
[Linnaeus] — Tormentil [Mabberley]
 [other usage] Pentafillo [Italian], Potentilla pimpinelloides,
Potentilla opaca, Potentilla hirta — Five Fingers Grass,
 Five Leaf, Cinquefoil 
Pentaphyllum has thin branches like festuca [fescue
grass] twenty centimetres long, on which is the seed.
It has leaves similar to mint, five on every stem but rarely
anywhere more, cut-in all around like a saw. The flower
is pale, white, or yellowish like gold. It grows in moist
places and by rivers; and it has a somewhat long reddish
root (thicker than black hellebore) that is of considerable
use. A decoction of the root reduced one third by
simmering (held in the mouth) is able to relieve
toothache. Used as a mouthwash it stops rotten ulcers in
the mouth; gargled, it relieves roughness of the throat;

and taken as a drink it helps flowing bowels, dysentery,
arthritis, and sciatica. Pounded finely, boiled in vinegar
and applied, it restrains herpes [ viral skin disease], and
dissolves swellings, goitres, hardened places, oedema,
aneurisms, suppurations, erysipela [ skin inflammation],
and conjunctivitis, and it heals skin lesions and psoriasis.
The juice from the tender root is good for disorders in the
liver and the lungs, and for deadly poisons. The leaves
are taken in a drink with honey water or diluted wine
and a little pepper for recurrent fevers; the leaves of four
little branches for a paroxysm every fourth day, three for
a paroxysm every third day, and one for a paroxysm
every day. They help epilepsy (taken as a drink for thirty
days), and three glasses of the juice of the leaves (taken as
a drink for some days) soon cures jaundice. Applied with
salt and honey they heal wounds and fistulas. Taken as a
drink (or else applied) it helps those who are broken
[foreskin or hymen], and stops flows of blood. It is cut for
washing, discharges of blood, and purification.  
(If anyone carries pentadactylon [cinquefoil] around his
body he remains without suffering. It helps the eyes,
tumours [possibly goitre], hardened tonsils, the uvula,
sores under the tongue, the joints, disorders of the
nerves, the teeth, and scabies [itchy parasitical disease]
caused by a pernicious famine, as well as drawing down
the afterbirth. A decoction (poured on the hands) is
excellent against fears and enchantments, therefore
gather the herb when the moon increases at the time of
the sun arising.) It is also called pentapetes, pentatomon,
pentadactylon, pseudoselinon, callipetalon, xyloloton,
xylopetalon, asphalton, pentacoenon, or thymiatitis; the
Egyptians call it orphitebeoce, some, enotron, the Magi,
unguis ibis, some, ala ibis, or hermodactylon, the Romans,
quinquefolium, the Gauls pempedula, and the Dacians,
propedula. 
4-43. PHOINIX
SUGGESTED: Hordeum murinum — Wall Barley
Phoenix has leaves similar to barley only shorter and
narrower, with an ear [of seed] similar to lolium
[2-116, 4-140]; branches around the root six fingers in
length, and the ears seven or eight. It grows in fields and

on newly-mortared roofs. A decoction (taken as a drink in 
hard wine) it is able to stop discharges of the intestines,
the excessive discharges of blood from the womb, and
excessive urine. Some say that it is a blood-stauncher,
bound in red wool and hanged about one. It is also called
rhus, anchinops, phoenicopteron, rhus stachyos, or ostheles.
The Romans say palolucupinum, the Egyptians, athnon. 
4-44. IDAIA RHIZA
UNKNOWN — this means root from Ida
Idaea radix has similar leaves to oxymyrsine near which
there grows out (as it were) little tendrils and flowers.
The root of this is especially astringent serving as such for
those for whom there is need. It is taken in a drink for
discharges of the intestines and women's excessive
menstrual discharges. It stops all discharges of blood.
4-45. RHODIA RADIX
SUGGESTED: Rhodia-radix [Fuchs], Radix rhodia [Bauhin], 
 Rhodiola rosea [Linnaeus], Sedum rhodiola [in Sprague],
 Sedum roseum — Roseroot, Rosy-flowered Stonecrop 
Rhodia radix  grows in Macedonia, similar to costus
[1-15] but lighter and uneven, making a scent when
bruised similar to that of roses. It is useful for those
aggrieved with headaches, bruised and applied with a
little rosaceum [1-53] and applied moist to the forehead
and temples. It is also called rhodida.

Hippuris grows in moist places and ditches. It has
empty little reddish stalks distinguished by joints
growing one into another, and around them many thin
 587
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

rushy leaves. It grows to a height climbing on the trunks
of trees standing nearby, and hangs on them. It is
surrounded with many black filaments similar to the tail
of a horse. The root is woody and hard, and the herb is
astringent. The juice of it stops discharges of blood from
the nostrils. A decoction (taken as a drink with wine)
helps dysentery and induces urine. Pounded into small
pieces (and sprinkled on) it closes bleeding wounds. Both 
the root and herb help coughs and asthma. It is said also
that a decoction of the leaves (taken as a drink in water)
joins openings of the intestines, and any cutting-apart of
the bladder, and hernia. It is also called trimachion,
anabasis, cheredranon, phaedra, itiandendron, gis, or
schoniostrophon, while the Egyptians say pherphram, the
Magi, cibus Saturni, the Romans, equinalis, and some, salix
equinalis, anabasion, or ephudron.   
4-47. IPPOURIS ETERA 
SUGGESTED:  Equisetum longius, Hippuris, Polygonum foemina
[Fuchs], Equisetum palustre [Linnaeus] — Meadow Horsetail
[other usage]  Equisetum hyemale, Equisetum scirpoides
— Common Scouring Bush 
Hippuris alterum  has a stalk that is straight, even
higher than a foot (as it were) empty, with shorter,
whiter, softer filaments at distances. Mixed with vinegar
it heals wounds, having the same strength as that above.
It is also called equitium, chedra, or gyon, while the Romans 
say salix equinalis.

strength. That in Cilicia grows on oaks [with grains]
similar in shape to a little snail, which the women there
gather by mouth, and call them coccum.
4-49. TRAGION
SUGGESTED: Chenopodium vulvaria, Tragium germanicum 
— Stinking Motherwort
Tragium grows only in Crete. It has leaves, stems and
seed similar to lentiscus [1-90] but all smaller. It has a
liquid similar to gum. The leaves, seed and fluid (applied
with wine) draw out arrowheads, splinters, and all things 
fastened within. A decoction (taken as a drink) cures slow 
painful urination, breaks stones in the bladder, and
induces the menstrual flow. A teaspoonful is taken. They
say that wild goats that have been shot feed on this herb
and put out the arrows.
4-50. TRAGION ALLO
SUGGESTED: Herba à cent goûts [French], Artemisia vulgaris
— Motherwort, Mugwort 
Tragium alterum  has leaves similar to scolopendrium
[3-121], and a thin white root similar to wild raphanus, 
which is eaten (raw or boiled) to help dysentery. In the
autumn the leaves put out the scent of a goat. As a result it 
is called tragium. It grows in steep hilly places. It is also
called tragos, tragoceros, scorpion, or garganon, while the
Romans say cornulaca, some, bituensa, the Dacians, salia,
the Egyptians, sober, and the Africans, achiosm.
4-51. TRAGOS 
SUGGESTED: Tragus berteronianus — Carrot Seed Grass 
see 2-115
Tragus grows particularly near the sea. It is a little
shrub, on the ground, somewhat long, not large,
about twenty centimetres tall or more. It has no leaves,
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK
 591

but on the branches there hang (as it were) many little red 
kernels about the size of wheat, sharp on the top,
especially astringent to the taste. Ten kernels of the seed
of this (taken as a drink with wine) help the abdomen and 
women having their discharges [menstrual flow]. Some
also beat it and make it into tablets for storage to use later.
It is also called scorpion, or traganos.
4-52. SCHOINOS 
SUGGESTED: Schoenus incanus — Bog Rush 
Schoenus ferrugineous  — Rusty Bog Rush

 Juncus acutus — Sharp Rush, Dutch Rush 
see 1-16
Two types of shoenus are found, the one of which is
called the smooth juncus, the other the sharp juncus,
pointed on the top, and of this again there are two types 
for one is barren, and the other has a round, black seed —
but the reeds of this are thicker and more fleshy. There is
a third type — much more fleshy and rougher than the
first two — which is called holoschoenos, and this also has
seed on the top similar to that before it. The seed of any of
them (dried and taken in a drink with diluted wine) stops 
discharges of the intestines, and excessive bloody
discharges, and induces urine. It is also good for
headaches, and the tender leaves near the root (applied)
are good for harvest spider bites. The Ethiopian juncus
has seed that will cause sleep. We must beware of too
much of it in liquid medicines for it encourages sleep
excessively. It is also called juncus laevis, oxypternos, or
supercilium solis,  while the Romans say juncus marinus ,
some, juncus manualis, and the Africans, chudua.

jaundice. It also helps the fluids of the mouth and tongue
[saliva]. 
4-54. PARONUCHIA
SUGGESTED: Paronychia serpyllifolia 
— Thyme-leaved Nailwort
Paronychia grows among rocks. It is a small shrub
similar to peplus — less in length but larger in the
leaves. It is applied (bruised) to all, to heal whitlows and
favus [contagious honeycombed skin disease]. It is also
called adocetos, neuras, or phrynion, while the Romans call
it unguinalis.

SUGGESTED: Chrysocoma [Bedevian] — Goldylocks 
ALSO: Chrysocoma linosyris, Chrysocoma villosa
Chrysocome is a small shrub twenty centimetres long
with filaments like corymbi [flattened inflorescences] 
resembling hyssop [3-30]; a slender thick root like black
hellebore — not unpleasant to the taste, equal to cyprus
[1-124], somewhat sour in its sweetness. It grows in
shady, rocky places. The root is warming and binding —
of suitable use for the liver and pneumonia. It is taken
(boiled with honey water) for cleansing the womb. It is
also called chysitis, chrysanthemon, amarantum, or the
beard of Jupiter, while the Romans say Iovis barba , the
Africans, dubath, and some, burchumath.

Helichrysum (with which they crown their statues)
has a little stem — white, green, straight and strong
— and narrow leaves (similar to those of abrotanum) set
apart at distances, the filaments circular, shining like
gold; a round tuft, (as it were) dry bunches of berries, and
a thin root. It grows in rough places near running water.
A decoction of the filaments (taken as a drink with wine)
helps painful urination, the bites of snakes, sciatica, and
hernia. A decoction (taken as a drink with must [pulp
from grapes]) induces the menstrual flow, and dissolves
clots of blood in the bladder or bowels. Thirty grains in a
dilution of white wine (given to one fasting) stops
dripping fluids. It is stored together with clothes,
protecting them from moths. It is also called
chrysanthemon, while some call it amarantum.

Corn Chrysanthemum
 Chrysanthemum coronarium — Garden Chrysanthemum,
Crown Marigold, Crown Daisy 
Chrysanthemon is a tender shrubby herb, bringing out
smooth stalks, very jagged leaves all around, and
yellowish flowers strongly shining with an eye (which is
why it is called this). It grows in towns, and the stalks are
eaten as vegetables. The flowers (pounded into small
pieces with wax ointment) are said to dissolve steatomata
[encysted fatty tumour]. It gives the jaundiced a good
colour in good time given to drink after they have spent a
long time in the baths. (Chrysanthemon you take out of the
earth before the rising of the sun. They are astringent to

averting women witches and all enchantments.) It is also
called bupthalmum, calchas, chalcitis, chalcanthum, or
chalcanthemon, the Romans say acantha, the Thuscans,
garuleum, and the Africans, churzeta.
4-59. AGERATON
SUGGESTED: Achillea ageratum — Sweet Maudlin, Milfoil
 Ageratum conyzoides — Floss Flowers, Goat Weed, 
Bastard Agrimony, Celestine 
Ageratum is a low shrub twenty centimetres long, full
of single sprigs, similar (especially) to origanum;
with a tuft on which is a flower (like a protuberance) of a
golden colour, smaller than helichrysum. It is called
ageratum because the flower remains for a long time,
keeping its colour. A decoction of it is burning [to take or
use]. Smoke from the herb itself is inhaled to induce the
movement of urine, and to soften hardness around the
womb.

SUGGESTED: Peristereon, Vervain [Pliny], Verbenaca recta,
Verbena recta [Fuchs], Sinapis alterum genus sylvestre, 
Erysimum vulgare [Bauhin], Erysimum officinale [Linnaeus],
Sisymbrium officinale [in Sprague] 
— Hedge Mustard [Mabberley]
[other usage] Verbena triphylla, Aloysia citriodora, Lippia citrata,
Lippia citriodora — Lemon Verbena, Herb Louisa
Peristereon orthos grows in watery places. It seems to be
named this because doves gladly stop around it. It is
a n herb with a height of twenty centimetres (or rather
more) the whitish leaves cut-in, growing out of the stalk.
It is found for the most part with only one shoot and one
root. It seems that the leaves (applied as a pessary with
rosaceum [1-53] or new swines’ grease) cause womb pains
to stop. Applied with vinegar it represses erysipela
[streptococcal skin infection] and rotten ulcers, and joins
new wounds, and with honey it heals old ones with a
new skin. The upright peristereon extends the pudendum
[genitals], but that which bends is drying. The upright
(tied to one) is good for pains of the eyes, dimness of
sight, and headache, and it eases weariness. Bruised with
vinegar it immediately dissolves scrofulous tumours
[glandular swelling], goitres, and hardened tonsils.
When anyone shivers with a fever let someone with
branches from this stand before him and immediately he
is cured. It is also called trygonium, bunion, sacra herba, or
philtrodotes; the Egyptians say pempsempte, the Magi,
Iunonis lachryma, some say the blood of the weasel, the
Romans, crista gallinacea, and some, ferrea, trixalis, exupera, 
or herba sanguinalis.

cut-in all around, drawing to an azure [blue]. The root is
somewhat long and thin; the flowers purple and thin.
The leaves and root (given to drink with wine or smeared
on) are useful against snakes. A teaspoonful of a
decoction of the leaves with thirty grains of frankincense
in one half-pint of old wine is taken as a drink for
jaundice by one fasting for forty days. The leaves
(applied) lessen inflammation and long-lasting oedema,
and clean foul ulcers. The whole herb (boiled with wine)
breaks crusts all around in the tonsils. Gargled, it stops
erosive ulcers in the mouth. An infusion of it sprinkled in
feasts is said to make the guests merrier [ relaxant]. The
third joint from the earth (with all the leaves) is given to
drink to those who have a paroxysm every third day. The
fourth joint is given to those who have a paroxysm every
fourth day. They call it sacra herba because it suitable for
use as amulets in purification. It is also called peristereon
[huption], erigenion, chamaelycon, sideritis, curitis,
phersephonion, Iovis colum, dichromon, callesis, hipparison, or
demetrias; the Egyptians say pemphthephtha; Pythagoras
calls it erysisceptron, and the Romans, cincinnalis.
4-62. ASTRAGALOS
SUGGESTED: Astragalus gummifera — Astragal, Milk Vetch
 Astragalus glycyphyllos — Milk Vetch, Liquorice Vetch
see 1-113
Astragalus is a small little shrub on the ground, similar
to chickpea in the leaves and sprigs. The little leaves
are purple, and the root lies underneath — round, of a
good amount, similar to the radish, with strong, black,
hard growths folded one within another like horns —
pleasantly astringent to the taste. It grows in windy,
shady and snowy places, and in great abundance in
Memphis, Arcadia. A decoction of the root (taken as a
drink in wine) stops flowing bowels and induces urine. It
is good (similarly) dried into powder and sprinkled on
old ulcers, and it staunches blood. It is pounded with
difficulty because of the solidity of it. It is also called
chamaesyce, onyx, or gatales, the Romans say pinus trivius,
as well as ficus terrae, and some call it glacula, scene talum,
or nonaria.

 Hyacinthus racemosus caeruleus monor latifolius [Bauhin],
Hyacinthus botyroides [Linnaeus], Muscari botyroides

 ALSO: Scilla bifolia [Linnaeus] — Squill
Hyacinthus has leaves similar to a bulbus [2-200]; a
smooth green stalk twenty centimetres long,
thinner than a little finger; a curled calyx lying on it full of
flowers of a purple colour, and the root similar to bulbus.
Smeared with white wine on boys this is thought to keep
them hairless; it also is therapeutic for the bowels. A
decoction (taken as a drink) induces urine, and helps
those bitten by harvest spiders. The seed is more
astringent and is put in treacles. A decoction (taken as a
drink with wine) cleanses jaundice. It is also called
helonias, or porphyranthes; the Romans call it vaccinium,
and some, ulcinum.
4-64. MEKON ROIAS
SUGGESTED: Papaver-erraticum primum [Fuchs], Papaver rhoeas
[Linnaeus] — Field Poppy, Corn Rose, Corn Poppy
Papaver erraticum is called this because it quickly casts
away its flower; it grows in fields in the spring, at
which time it is also gathered. The leaves are similar to
origanum, eruca [2-170], chicory, or thyme — jagged but
longer and rough. It has a downy stalk — straight, rough,
a foot in height.  The flower is purple and sometimes
white, similar to that of the wild anemone; the head is
somewhat long, yet somewhat smaller than that of
anemone; the seed is red. The root is somewhat long,
whitish, the thickness of a little finger, and bitter. Having
boiled five or six little heads of this (with three cups of
wine to reduce it to two), give it to drink to those whom
you would make sleep. A decoction of much as an

also mixed with honeyed confections and cakes for the
same purpose. The leaves (applied together with the
heads) heal inflammation. A decoction of them applied
with hot cloths (or sprinkled on) is sleep inducing. It is
also called oxytonum; the Romans call it papaveralis, and
the Egyptians, nanti.
4-65. MEKON AGRIOS, MEKON
EMEROS
SUGGESTED: Papaver sativum [Fuchs], 
Papaver hortensis semine albo [Bauhin],
 Papaver somniferum var album [Linnaeus] 
— White Opium Poppy 
 Papaver somniferum var niger [Loudon] — Black Poppy
NARCOTIC. Cultivation of poppies with the intention of producing opium is illegal.
There is a poppy that is cultivated and set in gardens,
the seed of which is made into bread for use in the
time of health. They use it with honey instead of sesame,
and it is called thylacitis — having a somewhat long little
head and white seed. The other (which is wild and also
called pithitishas) has a head bending down,  and some
call it rhoeas [4-64] because a liquid flows out of it. There is
a third — more wild, more medicinal and longer than
these, with a head somewhat long — and they are all
cooling. The leaves and heads (boiled in water and
applied with hot cloths) cause sleep. A decoction is taken
as a drink against lack of sleep. The heads (pounded into
small pieces and mixed into poultices with polenta) are
good for inflammation and erysipela [ streptococcal skin
infection]. It is necessary for those who beat them when
they are green to make them into tablets, dry them for
storage, and then use them. The heads are boiled alone in
water until half, and then boiled again with honey until
the dullness is thickened, make a licking medicine
soothing for coughs, dripping fluids in the throat, and
abdominal afflictions. It becomes more effective if juice of 
hypocistis [1-127] and acacia are mixed with it.
The seed of the black poppy (pounded into small
pieces) is given to drink with wine for excessive
discharges of the bowels, and women's excessive
discharges. It is applied with water on the forehead and

temples for those who cannot sleep, but the liquid itself
(taken) is more cooling, thickening, and drying. A little of
it (taken with as much as a grain of ervum [2-129, 2-131]) is
a pain-easer, a sleep-causer, and a digester, helping
coughs and abdominal cavity afflictions. Taken as a drink 
too often it hurts (making men lethargic) and it kills. It is
helpful for aches, sprinkled on with rosaceum [1-53]; and
for pain in the ears dropped in them with oil of almonds,
saffron, and myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116]. For inflammation
of the eyes it is used with a roasted egg yolk and saffron,
and for erysipela [ streptococcal skin infection] and
wounds with vinegar; but for gout with women’s milk
and saffron. Put up with the finger as a suppository it
causes sleep. That liquid is best which is thick, heavy, and
sleepy in smell, bitter to the taste, easily pierced with
water, smooth, white, not sharp, neither clotted nor
growing thick in the straining (like wax), and when set in
the sun flowing abroad, and when lighted at a candle not
with a dark flame, and keeping strength in its smell after
it is put out. They counterfeit it by mixing glaucium
[3-100], gum, or juice of the wild lettuce. But dissolved,
that made from glaucium is a saffron colour. That of the
wild lettuce is faint in its smell and rougher. That of gum
is without strength and transparent. Some are come to so
much madness as to mix grease with it. It is set on fire for
eye medicines in a new ceramic jar until it appears to be
softer and a more yellowish red. 
Erasistratus says that Diagoras disallows the use of it
for those who are sick with ear sores or eye sores, because
it is a duller of the sight and a causer of sleep. Andreas
says that if it were not adulterated they would be blind
who were rubbed with it. Mnesidemus says that the use
of it is only effective to inhale, good to cause sleep, and
that otherwise it is hurtful. These things are false,
disproved by experience, because the efficacy of the
medicine bears witness to the work of it. 
It is not out of place to describe the way they gather
the liquid. Some beat the stems with the leaves, squeeze it 
out through a press, beat it in a mortar, and make it into
lozenges. This is called meconium and is weaker than
opium. It is necessary for those who make opium (after
the dew has dried away) to scarify around the asterisk
[star on top] with a knife so that it does not pierce into the
inside, and from the sides of the head make straight
incisions in the outside, and to wipe off the fluid that

return not long after, for there is found another

pounded in a mortar and stored as tablets, but in cutting
it you must stand back so that the liquid is not wiped
away on your clothes. It is also called chamaesyce, mecon
rhoeas, or oxytonon; the Romans say papaver, and the
Egyptians, wanti.
4-66. MEKON KERATITES
SUGGESTED: Papaver corniculatum [Fuchs, Brunfels],
Chelidonium glaucum [Linnaeus], Glaucium flavum [in
Sprague], Glaucium luteum — Horned Poppy, Sea Poppy
Papaver cornutum  has rough white leaves similar to
verbascum [4-104], jagged like a saw all around like
those of wild poppy, with the stalk the same, the flower a
pale yellow, with a little pod (bending like a horn) similar
to that of fenugreek, from which it is named. The seed is
small, black, similar to that of poppy. The thick black root
grows on the surface of the ground. It grows in rough
maritime places. The root (boiled in water until half the
amount remains and taken as a drink) is able to cure
sciatica and liver disorders, and to help those who urinate 
thick or cobweb-like stuff. An acetabulum [vinegar cruet]
of a decoction of the seed (taken as a drink with honey
and water) purges the bowels gently, and the leaves and
flowers (smeared on with oil) root out the crusts of ulcers. 
Rubbed on, it takes away argema [small white ulcer on the
cornea] and small clouds in the eyes of beasts. Some have
been deceived, thinking that glaucium [3-100] was made
of this, because of the resemblance of the leaves. In eating 
or drinking this same horned poppy the same symptoms
occur as in the taking of opium [above], and they fall
under the same remedies. The seed is gathered dry in the
summer. A decoction of the root is taken as a drink and it
cures dysentery. It is also called paralion, agreste papaver, or 
thalassium, the Romans say pabulum marinum , and the
Africans, sisimaca.

Papaver spumeum (called heracleum by some) has a stalk
twenty centimetres long, and the leaves especially
small, similar to radicula [radish], the seed white between
them, and the entire small herb is white and frothy. The
root is thin for the most part. The seed of this is gathered
in the summer when it is fully-grown, and when dried
falls away. A vinegar cruet of the seed (taken with honey

effectively good for epilepsy.

SUGGESTED: Hypecoum procumbens — Horned Cumin,

Hyoscyamus is a shrub that sends out thick stalks. The
leaves are broad, somewhat long, jagged, black,

the flowers of the pomegranate, hedged in with little
shields full of seed (like the poppy above). There are three 
important different types, however. For one bears almost
purple flowers, leaves similar to smilax [4-144, 4-145], a
black seed, and little hard, prickly shields. But the other
has yellowish flowers, with the leaves and pods more

tender, and the seed a faint yellow like that of iris. These
both cause delirium and sleep, and are scarcely usable.
The fittest for cures is the third kind, which is the gentlest
— fat, tender, and downy, with white flowers and white
seed. It grows near the sea and among the rubbish of
buildings. 
You must therefore use the white, but if this is not
present then you must use the yellow, but refuse the
black, which is the worst. The seed is juiced while tender,
and the leaves and the stalks are pounded and pressed,
the mass then dried in the sun. It is useful for a year
because it is soon spoiled. The seed of it (in particular) is
juiced, pounded until dry with hot water poured on it,
and so pressed out. The juice is better than the liquid, and 
better for pain. The green seed is pounded and mixed
with 'three months' wheat meal, made into tablets, and
stored. First of all the juice and that liquid made from the
dry seed is made for suppositories to take away pain, for
sharp hot mucus, ear pains, and the disorders of the
womb. With meal or polenta it is used for inflammation
of the eyes and feet, and other inflammation. Ten grains
of the seeds (taken in a drink with the seed of poppy,
honey and water) do the same things, and are also good
for coughs, mucus, fluid discharges of the eyes and their
other disorders, and for women's excessive discharges
[menstrual flow] and other discharges of blood. Pounded 
into small pieces with wine and applied, it is good for
gout, inflated genitals, and breasts swollen in childbirth.
It is effective mixed with other poultices made to stop
pain. The leaves (made into little balls) are good to use in
all medications — mixed with polenta or else applied by
themselves. The fresh leaves (smeared on) are the most
soothing of pain for all difficulties. A decoction of three or 
four (taken as a drink with wine) cures fevers called
epialae [sudden]. Boiled like vegetables and a tryblium
[plateful] eaten, they cause a mean disturbance of the
senses. They say if anyone gives a suppository with it to
someone that has an ulcer in the perineum that it has the
same effect. The root (boiled with vinegar) is a mouth
rinse for toothache. 
It is also called dioscyamos, pythonion, adamas,
adamenon, hypnoticum, emmanes, atomon, or dithiambrion;

SUGGESTED: Psyllium [Fuchs], Psyllium majus erectum
[Bauhin], Plantago psyllium [Linnaeus]— Psyllium, Flea Seed 
Psyllium has a rough leaf similar to coronopis [2-158]
only longer, stems twenty centimetres long, and the
whole herb little like hay. The stem comes from the
middle of the stalk, with two or three little pods rolled on
the top close together, in which is seed similar to fleas,
black and hard. It grows in fields and untilled places. 
Applied with rosaceum [1-53], vinegar, or water it is
cooling; it helps the arthritic, inflammation of the parotid
gland, tumours, oedema, dislocations and aches.
Smeared on with vinegar it heals the hernias of children
and those whose navels protrude. Having pounded an
acetabulum [vinegar cruet] of it into small pieces, they
must steep it in two fingers of water, and smear it on
(when the water has grown thick) for it cools abundantly. 
Put into boiling water it suppresses heat, and it is also
good against erysipela  [streptococcal skin infection]. They 
say that brought into a house (fresh) it does not allow
fleas to breed. Pounded with grease it cleans the foulness
and malignancies of ulcers, and the juice (with honey) is
good for running ears, and ears with worms. It is also
called cataphysis, cynocephalion, crystallium, cynomuia,
psylleris, or sicelioticon; the Sicilians call it conidijs, the
Romans, silvacium, some, herba pulicaria, and the Africans,

harmless to the taste, and it is cooling — as a result the
leaves (applied) are good for erysipela [streptococcal skin
infection] and shingles [herpes] with flour of polenta. By
themselves (pounded into small pieces and applied) they 
cure ulcers on the eyes and aches. Pounded into small
pieces with salt and applied, they help a burning
stomach, and dissolve inflammation of the parotid gland. 
The juice (with cerusa [wax], rosaceum [1-53] and sediment 
[of grapes]) is good against erysipela [streptococcal skin
infection] and herpes [viral skin infection]; and with bread 
for ulcers on the eyes. Gently poured on with rosaceum, it
is good for children with  psoriasis. It is mixed with
eyewashes instead of water, or (with an egg) for rubbing
on for sharp discharges. Dropped in the ears it helps
earache, and applied as a pessary in wool it stops
women's excessive discharges [menstrual flow]. The juice 
(kneaded together with yellow dung from barn hens and
applied in a linen cloth) is suitable for aegilopses [ulcer or
fistula in the inner angle of the eye]. It is also called
[strychnos] sative , the Romans call it strumum, some,
cacubalum, the Egyptians, allelo, the Gauls, scubulum, and

There is also another strychnos (which they properly
call halicacabum [bad poison] or physalis) with similar
leaves to that previously spoken of, yet broader, but the
stalks of this (after they have grown) bend towards the
earth. It has fruit in round pods similar to bladders —
reddish, round, smooth, like the kernel of a grape —
which the crown-plaiters use, plaiting with it wreaths for
the head. It has the same strength and use as garden
strychnos [above] except when eaten. The fruit (taken in a
drink) is able to clean away urinary jaundice. The herb of
either of them is juiced and dried in the shade for storage, 
and is available for the same uses. It is also called

 POISONOUS
Strychnos somnificum  is a shrub of a good size, with
many thick branches, with tails, hard to break, full of
fat leaves, similar to the quince, with a red flower of good
size, and the fruit in pods of a saffron colour. The root has
a somewhat red bark. It grows in rocky places not far
from the sea. A teaspoonful of a decoction of the bark of
this root (taken as a drink in wine) is sleep inducing,
milder than the liquid of poppy. But the fruit is too
urinary. A decoction of a cluster of twelve berries (taken
as a drink) is given for dropsy, but more induce a faint.
This is helped by a large quantity of honey and water
taken as a drink. The juice of it is mixed with medications
and lozenges to ease pain. Boiled in wine and held [in the
mouth] it helps toothache. The juice from the root
(rubbed on with honey) takes away dullness of the sight.
Some call this halicacabum [bad poison].

berries of cissus [2-210], soft as grapes. The root lies
underneath — white, thick, hollow, the length of about a
foot. It grows in hilly places open to the wind, and among 
rocks near the sea. A teaspoon of a decoction of the root
(taken as a drink with wine) is able to effect not
unpleasant fantasies [hallucinogenic]. Two teaspoonfuls
of a decoction (taken as a drink) make one beside himself
for three days, and four (taken as a drink) kill him. The
remedy of this is honey and water, taken as a drink in
copious amounts and vomited up again. Some have

Dorycnium is a shrub similar to a newly-planted olive,
with branches less than a foot long. It grows among
rocks not far from the sea. It has leaves similar to the olive
in colour but smaller, stronger and extremely coarse. The
flower is white, on the top it has little pods as thick as
those of cicer [2-126] in which are five or six little round
seeds, about the amount of little ervum [2-129, 2-131],
smooth, firm, and of various colours. The root is the
thickness of a finger and the length of a foot, and this
seems also to have a sleepy quality, and taken too much it 
kills. Some also say that the seed of it is taken for love
medicines. Crateuas calls it halicacabum [a bad poison], or

NARCOTIC, POISONOUS
Mandagoras has a root that seems to be a maker of
love medicines. There is one sort that is female,
black, called thridacias, with narrower, longer leaves than
lettuce, with a poisonous, heavy scent, scattered on the
ground. Among them are apples similar to serviceberries
— pale, with a sweet scent — in which is seed like a pear.
The two or three roots are a good size, wrapped within
one another, black according to outward appearance,
white within, and with a thick bark; but it has no stalk. 
The male is white, and some have called it norion. The
leaves are bigger, white, broad, smooth like beet but the
apples are twice as big — almost saffron in colour, sweet-
smelling, with a certain strength — which the shepherds
eat to fall asleep. The root is similar to that above, yet
bigger and paler, and it is also without a stalk. The bark of
the root is pounded and juiced while it is fresh, and
placed under a press. After it is stirred the beaters should
bottle it in a ceramic jar. The apples are also juiced in a
similar way, but the juice from them becomes weakened.
The bark from the root is peeled off, pierced with a
thread, and hanged up in storage. Some boil the roots in
wine until a third remains, strain it, and put it in jars. 
They use a winecupful of it for those who cannot
sleep, or are seriously injured, and whom they wish to
anaesthetise to cut or cauterize. Twenty grains of the
juice (taken as a drink with honey and water) expel
phlegm and black bile upward like hellebore, but when
too much is taken as a drink it kills. It is mixed with eye
medicines, medications to ease pain, and softening
suppositories. As much as five grains (applied alone)
expels the menstrual flow and is an abortifacient, and put 
up into the perineum as a suppository it causes sleep. The 
root is said to soften ivory, boiled together with it for six
hours, and to make it ready to be formed into whatever
shape a man wants. Applied with polenta, the new leaves 
are good both for inflammations of the eyes and ulcers.

They dissolve all hardnesses, abscesses, glandular
tumours [possibly goitre], and tumours. Rubbed on
gently for five or six days it defaces scars without
ulcerating. The leaves (preserved in brine) are stored for
the same uses. The root (pounded into small pieces with
vinegar) heals erysipela [ streptococcal skin infection],
and is used with honey or oil for the strikes of snakes.
With water it disperses scrofulous tumours [ glandular
swelling], g oitres and tumours; and with polenta it
soothes the pains of the joints. Wine from the bark of the
root is prepared without boiling. You must put three
pounds (of the bark of the root) into thirteen gallons of
sweet wine, and three cupfuls of it is given to those who
shall be cut or cauterized (as previously mentioned). For
they do not notice the pain because they are overcome
with dead sleep; and the apples (inhaled or eaten) are
sleep inducing, as is the apple juice. Used too much they
make men speechless. A decoction of the seed of the
apples (taken as a drink) purges the womb, and given as a 
pessary with sulphur that never felt the fire it stops the
red excessive discharge [ menstrual flow]. It is juiced —
the root first incised or cut around various ways — and
that which runs out is then gathered into a bowl; and the
juice is more effective than the liquid. The roots do not
bear liquid in every place; experience shows as much. 
They give out also that there is another sort called morion
growing in shady places and around hollows, having
leaves similar to the white mandrake but smaller (as it
were), twenty centimetres long, white, lying round
around the root. This is tender and white, a little longer
than twenty centimetres, the thickness of the great
finger. They say as much as a teaspoon of a decoction of
this (taken as a drink or eaten with polenta in placetum, or
food that is eaten with bread), will infatuate [cause
unconsciousness]. For a man sleeps in the same fashion
as when he ate it (sensible of nothing for three or four
hours) from the time that it is brought him. And
physicians also use this when they are about to cut or
cauterize [anaesthetic]. They say also that a decoction of
the root (taken as a drink with strychnos manicum) is an
antidote. It is also called antimelon, dircaea, circea, circaeum,
xeranthe, antimnion, bombochylon, or minon; the Egyptians
call it apemum, Pythagoras, anthropomorphon, some, aloitin,

thridacian, or cammaron; Zoroastres calls it diamonon, or
archinen, the Magi, hemionous, some, gonogeonas, the
Romans, mala canina, and some, mala terrestria.

SUGGESTED: Aconitum pardalianches [Fuchs], 
Solanum quadrifolium bacciferum [Bauhin], 
Paris quadrifolia [Linnaeus] — Herb Paris
[other usage] Aconitum napellus, Aconitum variable,
 Aconitum pyramidale — Monk’s Hood, Aconite, Wolf’s-bane
POISONOUS
Aconitum has three or four leaves similar to cyclamen
or cucumber, yet smaller and a little rough; with a
stalk of twenty centimetres, and a root similar to the tail
of a scorpion, glittering like alabaster. They say that the
root of this applied to a scorpion makes him insensible,
and that he is raised again by hellebore applied to him. It
is also mixed with pain-relieving medicines for eyes. Put
into lumps of meat and given to them, it kills panthers,
sows, wolves, and all wild beasts. It is also called
pardalianches, cammarum, thelyphonum, myoctonon, or
theriophonon.
4-78. AKONITON ETERON 
SUGGESTED: Aconitum luteum, Aconitum lycoctonum [Fuchs,
Linnaeus], Aconitum pyrenaicum,  Aconitum vulparia  
—Wolf’s-bane, Dog’s-bane
POISONOUSR
Aconitum alterum grows plentifully in Italy on the hills
called Vestini, differing from that above. It has
leaves similar to those of the plane tree but more jagged
and a great deal smaller and darker, with a bare stalk (like 
a stem of fern) the height of a foot or more. The seed is in
pods, in a way somewhat long; the black roots are like the 
fringes of squills [sea onions]; these they use for hunting
wolves, placing them into raw meat which, when eaten
by the wolves, kills them. It is also called cynoctonon,
lycoctonon, or white bean, while the Romans call it
colomestrum.

Conium maculatum [Linnaeus], Coriandrum maculatum
— Poison Hemlock, Herb Bennet, Common Hemlock 
[other usage] Cicuta virosa  —Water Hemlock, Cowbane 
POISONOUS
Conium sends out a great knotty stalk (similar to
marathrum [3-81]), with leaves similar to ferula but
narrower with a heavy smell, and on the tops, abnormal
growths and tufts, and a whitish flower with seed similar
to aniseed [3-65] only whiter. The root is hollow and not
deep. This is also one of the venomous herbs killing with
its coldness, but it is helped by unmixed wine. The tops
(or the filaments) are juiced before the seed is dry,
pounded, pressed out, and thickened by stirring in the
sun. Dried, this is very useful in cures. The juice is
effectively mixed with pain-relieving eyewashes or
salves. Smeared on, it removes herpes and erysipela
[streptococcal skin infection]. The herb and the filaments
(pounded into small pieces and smeared on about the
testicles) help lustful dreamers and nocturnal emission of
sperm; and smeared on, they weaken the genitals. They
drive away milk, prevent the breasts from enlarging
during virginity, and prevent the testicles in children
from developing. The most potent grows in Crete,
Megara and Attica, then that which grows in Chios and
Cilicia. It is also called  aegynos, ethusa, apolegousa, dolia,
amaurosis, paralysis, aphron creidion, coete, catechomenion,
abioton, apseudes, ageomoron, timoron, polyanodynos,
dardanis, or catapsyxis; Osthenes calls it babathy, the
Egyptians, apemphin, and the Romans, cicuta. 
4-80. MILAX
SUGGESTED: Taxus baccata [Pliny] — Yew Tree
POISONOUS
Milax is a tree similar to the fir in its leaves and their
quantities, growing in Italy and Narbona near
Spain. Chickens that eat the fruit of that which grows in
 631
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

Italy turn black, and men that eat it fall into
unconsciousness. That growing in Narbonie has such
great strength that those who sit underneath (or fall
asleep) are hurt by the shade, and that frequently they
die. This is mentioned as a warning. It is also called
thymalus, and the Romans call it taxus.
4-81. APOCUNON
SUGGESTED: Apocynum venetum — Venetian Dog’s-bane 
POISONOUS
Apocynon is a shrub with long willow-like stems, hard
to break; leaves similar to cissus [2-210] but softer
and sharper towards the top; with a heavy scent; full of
yellow juice, somewhat viscous. The fruit is like a pod of
beans, about the thickness of a finger, similar to a bladder, 
in which are little seeds — hard, small and black. Put into
bread and put out for them, the leaves of this kills dogs,
wolves, foxes, and panthers, and immediately dissolves
their lips. It is also called cynanchon, pardalianches,
cynomoron, cynocrambe, cynoctonon, phaleos, cynanche,
oligoros, hippomanes, onistis, ophioscorodon, cynarice, or
elaphoscordon; the Magi call it paralysis, the Romans,
brassica rustica, and some, canina.
4-82. NERION
SUGGESTED: Nerium, Oleander [Fuchs], Nerium oleander 
—  Rose Bay, Oleander
POISONOUS
Nerium is a well-known shrub, with longer, thicker
leaves than the almond; a flower similar to a rose,
and fruit similar to that of the almond, but with a horn
which (opened) is full of a downy stuff similar to
thistledown. The root is sharp, pointed, long, woody, and 
brackish to the taste. It grows in enclosed greens, sea-
bordering places and in places near rivers. The flower
and the leaves are able to kill dogs, asses, mules and most
four footed living creatures, but they preserve men [dead
bodies, perhaps]. A decoction is taken as a drink with
wine against the bites of venomous creatures, and more

sorts of living creatures such as goats and sheep die if
they drink the steepings of them. It is also called
rododaphne, rhododendron, spongos, or haemostaris; the
Romans call it rhododendron, oleander, and laurorosa, the
Lucanians, icmane, the Egyptians, scinphe, and the
Africans, rhodedaphane.
4-83. MUKETES
SUGGESTED: Fungi species — Mushrooms etc. 
SOME SPECIES POISONOUS
Fungi have a double difference for they are either
edible or poisonous, and come to be so on many
occasions, for they grow among rusty nails, rotten rags,
the holes of snakes, or among trees that bear harmful
fruits. Such as these also have a viscous coalesced fluid,
and stored after they are picked they quickly spoil,
growing rotten. Those that are not harmful (boiled in
broth) are sweet, yet for all that taken too much they hurt, 
being hard to digest, choking or breeding bile. All are
helped; drenched with nitre [saltpetre] and oil, or soaked
in a decoction of sharp brine or thymbra [3-45], or liquified
with origanum, or hen dung with vinegar, or syruped
with a quantity of honey. They are nourishing and hard
to dissolve, and are put out whole (for the most part) with 
the excrement. 
4-84. KOLCHIKON
SUGGESTED: Colchicum, Hermodactylis [Fuchs], 
Colchicum commune [Bauhin], Colchicum autumnale [Linnaeus]
— Meadow Saffron 
POISONOUS
When autumn ceases colchicum sends out a whitish
flower similar to the flower of saffron; afterwards
it bears leaves similar to bulbus [2-200], but fatter. The
stalk is twenty centimetres long; it has a red seed, and the
root has a tawny black bark which, peeled, and is found
white, tender, and full of sweet liquid. The bulb has a
central partition at which it sends out the flower. It grows
 635
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

abundantly in Messenia and at Colchos. Eaten, it kills by
choking, similar to mushrooms. We have described it so
that it may not lie hidden and be eaten instead of bulbus,
for it is strangely alluring to the inexperienced for its
pleasantness. To help those who eat these, give them
whatever helps those who eat mushrooms [above], and
cow's milk (taken as a drink) so that when this is at hand
they need no other help. It is also called  ephemerum, or
agrestis bulbus, and the Romans call it bulbus agrestis.
4-85. EPHEMERON 
SUGGESTED: Ephemerum-non-letale, Lilium convallium [Fuchs],
Lilium convallium album [Bauhin], Convallaria majalis
[Linnaeus] — Lily of The Valley
Ephemerum has leaves and a stalk similar to the lily but
whiter, the flowers white, bitter, and the seed soft.
The root lies underneath, single, the thickness of a finger,
long, astringent and sweet smelling. It grows in woods
and shady places. The root of this (used in a mouth rinse)
is a remedy for toothache. The leaves (boiled in wine and
smeared on) dissolve oedema and tumours without fluid. 
It is also called agrestis iris.
4-86. ELXINE
SUGGESTED: Helxine, Parietaria [Fuchs],
Parietaria officinarum et Dioscorides [Bauhin], 
Parietaria officinalis [Linnaeus] — Pellitory of the Wall
[other usage] Helxine soleirolii, Soleirolia soleirolii   
— Mind-your-own-business, Mother of Thousands
Helxine grows in mounds and walls. It has thin little
stalks, somewhat red, rough leaves similar to
mercury [4-191]; and around the stalks (as it were) sharp
little seeds, catching hold of cloths. The leaves are
astringent and cooling, as a result (smeared on) they heal
erysipela [ streptococcal skin infection], venereal warts,
dehydration, pannus [opaque thickening of cornea with
veins] that is beginning, all types of inflammation, and
oedema. The juice of it (mixed with cerussa [white lead
ore] and smeared on) helps erysipela [streptococcal skin
infection] and herpes [viral skin infection]; and taken with

cyprinum [1-65] and goat’s grease, it helps gout in the feet.
As much as a wine cupful of the juice (sipped) helps those 
who have coughed a long time, is an effective gargle and
ointment for inflamed tonsils, and dropped in the ears
with rosaceum [1-53] is good for earache. It is also called
sideritis, parthenium, heraclia, asyria, agrestis hygiena,
clibadium, or polyonymon.
4-87. ALSINE

[other usage] Alsine junipera, Alsine verna — Alsine
 Alsine procubens,  Arenaria procubens — Purslane, Chickweed,
Sandwort 
see 2-214
Alsine is named because it has leaves similar to the
little ears of a mouse, and it is also called alsine
because it loves shady woody places. It is a herb similar to
helxine [4-86] but lower, longer-leaved, and not rough,
and bruised it smells of cucumbers. Smeared on with
polenta, it is cooling and astringent, good for
inflammation of the eyes. The juice of it is dropped in the
ears for earaches, and in general it can do the same things
as helxine. It is also called mouse-ear, anthyllion,
myortochon, or myortosplenon; the Romans call it muris
auricula, and the Africans, laphotholabat.
4-88. PHAKOS EPI TON TELMATON
SUGGESTED: Lemna polyrrhiza, Spirodela polyrrhiza 
— Greater Duckweed 
  Lemna minor  — Water Lentils, Water Lens, Duckweed
Lens (which grows in marshes) is found in standing
waters, being a moss similar to lentils which is
cooling. It is good (applied both by itself or with polenta)
for all inflammation, erysipela [ streptococcal skin
infection], and gout of the feet; and it also heals vaginal
hernias found in children. It is also called wild lens , or
epipteron, the Romans call it viperalis, and some,
iceosmigdonos.

SUGGESTED: Sedum maius [Fuchs], Sedum majus vulgare
[Bauhin],  Sempervivum tectorum [Linnaeus] — Houseleek,
 Hens and Chickens, Jupiter’s Beard, Roof Houseleek 
The Greeks gave the name aizoon to sempervivum [Loudon].
The great aizoon is called this because of its evergreen
leaves. It sends out stalks a foot long or rather more,
the thickness of a big finger, fat, very flourishing, with
in-cuts (as it were) like the Characian tithymal [4-165a].
The leaves are fat, the size of a big finger, similar to a
tongue towards the top, those below bending
downwards, but those around the head set together one
to another, describing an eye-like circle. It grows in hilly
and tilled places. Some plant it on their houses. 
It is cooling and astringent; the leaves (applied by
themselves or with polenta) are good for erysipela, herpes
[viral skin infection], and gangrenous ulceration of the
cheeks, inflammation of the eyes, burns, and gout in the
feet. The juice is poured on with polenta and rosaceum
[1-53] for headaches, and it is given in drink to those
bitten by harvest spiders, those with diarrhoea, and for
dysentery. Taken as a drink with wine it draws out
roundworms, and in a pessary it stops women's excessive 
discharges [menstrual flow]. The juice is effective rubbed
on weak eyes, by reason of blood. It is also called aeithales,
ambrosion, chrysospermon, zoophthalmon, bouophthalmum,
stergethron, aeonion aichryson, holochryson, chrysanthemom,
protogonom, boros, or notios; the Magi call it paronychia,
some, chrysitis, the Romans, ceriacuspia, some, Jovis caulis,
leapetes, or sedum majus, and the Egyptians, pamphanes. 
4-90. AEIZOON TO MIXRON
SUGGESTED: Sedum minus mas [Fuchs], Sedum rupestre

Sempervivum parvum  [ aizoon] grows in walls, rocks,
mounds, and somewhat shady ditches. The many
little stalks emerge from one root, thin, full of little round,
fat, leaves, small, sharp on the top. It sends out a stalk in
the middle also, in size about twenty centimetres, with a
tuft and flowers, thin and green. The leaves of this have

the same strength as the previous one. Some call the
thin-leaved sempervivum, sempervivum parvum ,
petrophthes, or sempervivum sylvestre, and the Romans call
it sempervivum minus . Sempervivum is also called
petrophues, brotion, theobrotion, crobysson, chimerinen, or
ceraunia; the Romans call it vitalis, some, herba semperviva,
and the Egyptians, etijcelta.
4-91. AEIZOON ETERON
SUGGESTED: Sedi tertium genus [Fuchs], 
Sempervivum minus vermiculatum acre [Bauhin], 
Sedum acre [Linnaeus] — Wall Pepper, Stonecrop
[Mabberley]
There seems to be a third kind of sempervivum that has
little leaves, thicker, similar to those of portulaca
[4-168], and rough. It grows among rocks. It is warming,
sharp, and ulcerating, dissolving tumours [possibly
goitre] applied with goose grease. It is also called portulaca 
agrestis, or telephium, and the Romans call it illecebra.
4-92. KOTULEDON
SUGGESTED: Cotyledon lusitanica, Umbilicus erectus 
— Kidneywort, Navelwort, Venus’s Navelwort
 Cotyledon umbilicus — Cotyledon, Navelwort, Pennywort 
Umbilicus veneris has a leaf like an acetabulum [vinegar
cruet], round, hidden, and hollow, with a short little 
stalk in the middle in which is the seed. The root is round
like the olive. The juice of this and the leaves (rubbed on
with wine or squirted in), loosens the obstructions of the
skin in the genitals. Applied, it helps inflammation,
erysipela [ streptococcal skin infection], chilblains,
tumours [possibly goitre], and a burning stomach. The
leaves (eaten with the root) break stones [ urinary,
kidney], and induce urine. It is given with mead [honey
wine] for dropsy, and they also use it for love medicines.
It is also called scytalium, cymbalium, hortus veneris, terrae
umbilicus, stichis, or stergthron, and the Romans call it
umbilicus veneris.

There is also another kind of cotyledon with broader,
fat leaves similar to little tongues, thick around the
root, describing (as it were) an eye in the middle, similar
to the bigger sempervivum [4-89], astringent to the taste. It
has a thin little stalk, and on it flowers and seeds similar to 
hypericum [3-171], but the root is bigger. It is good for the
same uses as sempervivum. It is also called cymbalium. 
4-94. AKALUPHE, AKALUPHE ETERA
SUGGESTED: Urtica romana, Urtica vera [Fuchs], 
Urtica pilulifera [Linnaeus], Urtica dioica, Urtica urens
[Linnaeus] — Roman Nettle [Loudon] 
Urtica maior [Fuchs], Urtica urens maxima [Bauhin],
 Urtica dioica [Linnaeus] — Stinging Nettle
[other usage] Acalypha indica — Acalypha,
 Three-seeded Mercury 
Acalyphe has two varieties. One is wilder, sharper and
darker in the leaves, and it has a seed similar to
hempseed only smaller, and the other has a thin seed, not 
as sharp. The leaves of either of them (smeared on with
salt) heal anything bitten by dogs, gangrene,
malignancies, cancers, and the foulness of ulcers,
dislocations, tumours, inflammation of the parotid gland, 
pannus [opaque thickening of cornea with veins], and
abscesses. They are applied to the splenical with wax
ointment. The leaves (pounded into small pieces and
applied with the juice) are good for discharges of blood
from the nostrils. Pounded small and applied with myrrh 
[1-77, 1-73, 4-116] they induce the menstrual flow; and
the new leaves (applied) restore a prolapsed womb. A
decoction of the seed (taken as a drink with passum [raisin 
wine]) is an aphrodisiac and opens the womb. Licked in
with honey it helps asthma, pleurisy and pneumonia,
and fetches up stuff out of the chest. It is mixed with
antiseptic preparations. The leaves (boiled together with
small shellfish) soften the bowels, dissolve windiness,
and induce urine. Boiled with barley water they bring up
stuff from the chest. A decoction of the leaves (taken as a

the juice is gargled to keep down an inflamed uvula. It is
also called knide, or adice, the Romans call it urtica, the
Egyptians, selepsion, the Dacians, dyn. The other acalyphe
is also called knide, and the Romans call it urtica mollis.

SUGGESTED: Galeopsis, Scrophularia maior, Ficaria [Fuchs],
Scrophularia aquatica [Linnaeus] — Water Figwort
[other usage] Galeopsis tetrahit — Galeopsis, Holy Hemp,
Common Hempnettle 
Galiopsis — the whole little shrub with the stalk and
leaves is similar to the nettle, but the leaves are
smoother, and smell strongly if bruised. The thin flowers
are nearly purple. It grows in hedges, byways and house
courtyards everywhere. The leaves, juice, stalk and seed
are able to dissolve hard lumps, cancers, tumours
[possibly goitre], inflammation of the parotid gland, and
pannus [opaque thickening of cornea with veins]. They
must lay on a poultice of this twice a day, making the
poultice lukewarm, and a decoction of this used in a
warm pack is of benefit. It is also good applied with salt
for nomae [grazer disease, eats away muscle, tissue and
bones], other gangrenes, and rotten ulcers. It is also called 
guleobdolon, or galephos, the Egyptians call it aethopi, and
the Romans, urtica labeonis.
4-96. GALLION
SUGGESTED: Gallium [Fuchs], Galium luteum [Bauhin],
Galium verum [Linnaeus] — Ladies' Bedstraw, Rennet
Gallion is called this because coagulates milk instead
of rennet. It has little branches, with the leaves very
similar to aparina yet straight, and a thin yellowish flower
on  top, in thick abundance and smelling good. The
flower is smeared on for burns from fire, and it stops
flows of blood. It is also mixed with waxy rose ointment
and placed in the sun till it turns white, and this is a
 647
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

medication for acopon. The root encourages sexual
intercourse [aphrodisiac]. It grows in marshy places. It is
also called gallerium, or, galatium.
4-97. ERIGERON 
SUGGESTED: Erigeron, Senetio [Fuchs, Brunfels], 
Senecio minor vulgaris [Bauhin], Senecio vulgaris [Linnaeus]  
— Groundsel
Senecio is a reddish little stalk a foot high, with little
leaves like eruca [2-170], jagged at the edges only a
great deal smaller; the flowers are yellowish, quickly
opening, and after blowing turn into down. This is also
why it was called erigeron, because in the spring the
flowers turn gray like hair; the root is of no use. It grows
mostly on unmortared stone walls and about towns. The
leaves with the flowers are cooling. The leaves smeared
on with a little wine, or else by themselves, cure
inflammations from stones [kidney, urinary], and of the
perineum. With manna thuris  [1-83] it heals other
wounds, and nerves. The down smeared on by itself in
vinegar does the same. Drunk while fresh they cause
strangling. The whole stalk soaked with water and drunk 
with must [grape pulp] cures pains of the stomach from
cholera. Some call it erechthites, the Romans, herbulum,
some senecium]
 4-98. THALIKTRON
SUGGESTED: Thalictrum aquilegifolium 
— Columbine-leaved Meadow Rue 
 Thalictrum flavum, Thalictrum nigricans — Fen Rue,

Thalictrum has leaves similar to coriander but fatter,
and a little stalk the thickness of rue on which are the
leaves. These are pounded into small pieces and applied
to form a skin over ulcers that will not heal. It grows
(especially) in fields.

SUGGESTED: Bryon, Bryum, Brion [French], Corallina officinalis
— Thread Moss, Wall Moss,  Corallina 
 Muscus arboreus — Moss, Lichen Moss 
Muscus marinus grows on stones and shells by the sea 
— hairy, slender, without a stalk, very astringent
— good for inflammation, and gout in the feet that needs
astringency. It is also called ballaris, or irane, and the
Romans call it gnomeusilum.
4-100. PHUKOS THALASSION
SUGGESTED: Fucus vesiculosus — Bladderwrack 
Fucus marinus  — one sort of it is broad, the other
somewhat long and almost purple and the third,
white, growing in Crete near the ground, very
flourishing, and not perishable. All are cooling in
poultices, good for gouty afflictions and inflammation,
but they must use them while they are still moist (before
they dry). Sicacer says that the Phoenician [red] is good
against snakes, which some have thought to be that little
root which women use which is also called fucus. 
4-101. POTAMOGEITON,
POTAMOGEITON ETEROS
SUGGESTED: Potamogeton [Fuchs], Potamogeton rotundifolium
[Bauhin], Potamogeton natans [Linnaeus] — Devil’s Spoons,
Tenchweed, Broad-leaved Pondweed
Potamogeton has a thick leaf (similar to beet) standing a
little above the water. It cools and is therapeutic, and
is good for itches, feeding ulcers, and old ulcers. It is
called this because it grows in marshes and watery places.
There is also another potamogeton with leaves the
same but longer and thinner, the thin little stalks the
same, full of a reddish seed. Eaten, this is binding, and
pounded into small pieces with wine and an acetabulum
[vinegar cruet] taken as a drink, it helps dysentery and
the abdominal cavity, and stops women's excessive

bloody discharges [ menstrual flow]. It also grows in
watery, marshy places. It is also called stachyitis; the
Romans call it fatalist, the Egyptians, ethenchis.
4-102. STRATIOTES O EN TOIS UDASIN
SUGGESTED: Stratiotes aloides — Water Soldier 
 Pistia stratiodes — Water Lettuce, Tropical Duckweed
Stratiotes which grows in the water is called this
because it swims on the waters and lives without a
root. It has a leaf similar to that of sempervivum [4-89 to
4-91] yet bigger. It is cooling and stops bloody discharges
from the kidneys. A decoction (taken as a drink and also
smeared on with vinegar) keeps wounds, erysipela
[streptococcal skin infection] and oedema uninflammed.
It is also called river stratiotes, the Egyptians call it tibus,
and the Magi, the blood of a cat.
4-103. STRATIOTES CHILIOPHULLOS
SUGGESTED: Stratiotes-millefolium [Fuchs], 
Millefolium vulgare album [Bauhin], Achillea millefolium
[Linnaeus], Millefolium, Stratiotes, Supercilium veneris
— Yarrow, Milfoil, Nosebleed
Stratiotes millefolius  is a small little shrub twenty
centimetres long (or more) with leaves similar to the
feathers of a young bird, and the abnormal growths of the 
leaves are very short and jagged. The leaves are (most
chiefly) similar in their shortness and roughness to wild
cumin yet even shorter; and the tuft is thicker than this
and fuller, for it has small shoots on the top on which are
the tufts in the shape of dill [3-67]; the flowers are small
and white. It grows in somewhat rough fields and
especially around the ways. This herb is excellent for an
excessive discharge of blood, old and new ulcers, and for
fistulas [ulcers].

[Linnaeus], Verbascum densifolium, Thapsus barbatus
— Great Mullein, Aaron's Rod
IRRITANT RESIN
[other usage] Jerusalem Sage — Phlomis fructiosa
Wickweed — Phlomis floccosa
Phlomis has a double difference, for one sort is white
and the other black; and of the white, one is female
and the other male. The leaves of the female are similar to 
brassica but with many more filaments, broader, and
white. The white stalk is a foot high or more, somewhat
rough. The flowers are white or of a faint aker [ochre]; the
seed black; the root long, with a hard taste, the thickness
of a finger. It grows in fields. That called the male is
white-leaved, somewhat long, narrower in the leaves,
and thinner in the stalk. The black is similar to the white
in all things, yet it is broader-leaved and darker in the
leaves. It is also called plenos; the Romans call it
verbasculum, and some, foeminalis. 
There is also another sort called wild, with tall stems
and tree-like, the leaves similar to sage, with sprigs
around the stems similar to marrubium, and a yellowish
flower like gold. These phlomides are also two-fold, rough, 
growing near the ground, with round leaves. 
There is a third phlomis, called lychnitis, sometimes
thryallis, with three or four or more thick fat rough leaves, 
good for candle wicks. Of the two former, the root is
astringent; as a result the amount of a knucklebone is
effective (given with wine in a drink) for flowing
[diarrhoea]. A decoction of it is good for hernia,
convulsions, bruises, as well as wounds from falls, and
old coughs; and used as a mouthwash it soothes
toothache. The golden colour in the flowers dyes the hair,

and wherever it is put it attracts woodworm. The leaves
(boiled in water) are applied for oedema and
inflammation of the eyes, and with honey (or wine) for
eating ulcers. With vinegar it heals wounds and helps

apiastrum [3-118], or arction [4-106], putting out many
wings. The seed is about the size of ervum [2-129, 2-131]
with two in one capsule. There are many long thick roots
from the very bottom, gluey to the taste, but dried they
become black and hard like horns. It grows abundantly in 
Messenia and Ida. The root of this is called arcturum, and
it has leaves similar to verbascum, only rougher and
rounder. The root is tender, sweet and white; and the
stalk is soft and long, similar to little cumin. The root and
seed of this (boiled in wine) are held in the mouth to
lessen toothache; and it is applied with hot cloths for
burns and chilblains. It is taken as a drink in wine for
sciatica and painful urination.
4-106. ARKTION
SUGGESTED: Arctium minus — Lesser Burdock
Arctium (which some call arcturum) has leaves similar
to verbascum [4-104] but rougher and rounder; the
tender root is sweet and white; and the soft stalk long like 
little cumin. The root and seed of this (soaked in wine)
have the strength (held in the mouth) to soothe
toothache. It is a poultice for burns and chilblains. It is
also drunk in wine for sciatica and dysuria.

teaspoon of a decoction (taken as a drink with pine
kernels) helps spitters of blood and corrupt matter, and
smeared on, it soothes sores from wrenching the joints
around. The leaves are effective applied to old ulcers. It is
also called personata, prosopis, prosopion, or aparine, the
Romans call it personacea, and some, lappa.

leaves similar to a star. The leaves around the stalk are
somewhat long and rough. Smeared on, it helps an
inflamed stomach, as well as inflammation of the eyes
and the thighs, and prolapse of the perineum. A
decoction of the purple part of the flower (taken as a
drink with water) helps the synanchic [abscessed throat],
and epilepsy in children. It is good (applied fresh and
moist) for inflammation of the thighs. 
Gathered when it is dry (with the left hand of the
pained party) and hanged about the thigh, it frees him of
the pain. It grows among rocks and in coarse places. The
stars [flowers] of this shine in the night, for those who do
not know it when they see it think it is a spirit, and it is
found by the keepers of sheep. Crateuas the herbalist
relates that pounded (green) with old swines’ grease it is
good for one bitten by a mad dog, or for a swollen throat,

which is a little flower, very sweet, of a purple. It grows in
shady rough places. It is cooling, so that the leaves
(applied by themselves or with polenta) help a burning
stomach, inflammation of the eyes, and prolapse of the
perineum. A decoction of the purple part of the flower
(taken as a drink with water) helps the synanchic
[abscessed throat], and epilepsy of children. It is also

stalks to drink, boiling to a third the whole herb with the
roots and seed. Give that which has four stalks to
someone who has fevers with recurrent paroxysms every 
fourth day, but these must be boiled with wine. They say
that it is good to use for abscesses (like verbascum [4-104]).
It has leaves laying on the ground, both rougher and
darker (like the tongue of an ox) which, put into wine, is
thought to be a cause of mirth. The Magi call it genitura
felis; Osthenes calls it tzanuchi, the Egyptians, antuenrin
besor, the Romans, lingua bovis , some, libanis, and the
Africans ansanaph.

SUGGESTED: Leontopodium vulgare — Common Lion’s Foot
 Gnaphalium leontopodium — Everlasting,
 Lion’s Paw Cudweed
 Leontopodium alpinum — Edelweiss, Live Ever, Lion's Foot
Leontopodion is a two-finger long little herb with small,
slender, strong leaves the length of three or four
fingers — rough, woolier towards the root, and whitish.
On the tops of the stalks are little heads (as it were) bored
through, which have black flowers. The seed is hardly
seen because of the down that wraps it. The root
underneath is small. They also say that this is prescribed
for love medicines to be hanged on one, and that it
dissolves small swellings. It is also called zoonychon,
aetonychon, cemus, damnamene, idiophyton, phytobasila,

crossion, or crossophthoon. The Magi call it sanguis crocodili,
some, crocomerion, the Egyptians, daphnoenes, the
Romans, minercium, and some, neumatus, palladium, or
flammula.
4-132. IPPOGLOSSON
SUGGESTED: Ruscus aculeatus — Butcher’s Broom 
See 4-147
Hippoglosson is a little shrub similar to myrtus agrestis
[myrtle] with thin leaves, and prickly filaments;
and on the top (as it were) a little tongue by the leaves.
The filaments seem to be an effective amulet for
headaches. The root and juice are mixed with warm
compresses. Some call this antirrhinon, anarrhinon, or
lychnis sylvestris.
4-133. ANTIRRINON
(KUNOKEPHALON)
SUGGESTED: Antirrhinum asarina — Bastard Asarum
 Antirrhinum cymbalaria, Linaria cymbalaria, Cymbalaria muralis
— Cymbalaria, Kenilworth Ivy, Ivy-leaved Toadflax 
 Antirrhinum orontium — Lesser Snapdragon, Calf’s Snout
see 4-143
Antirrhinon is a herb similar to anagallis [2-209] in the
leaves and stalk, but the flowers are purple, similar
to leucoion [3-138] only smaller, so it was also called
sylvestris lychnis. It bears a fruit like the nostrils of a calf,
carnation-like in appearance. It is said that (used as a
personal ornament) this opposes poisons, and that
rubbed on with lily oil or cyprine [nutsedge], it makes one
beautiful. It is also called anarrhinon, and some have
called it lychnis agrestis.

SUGGESTED: Catananche graeca, Hymenoema graecum,
Hymenoema tournefortii — Candy Lionsfoot 
 Catananche caerulea — Cupid’s Dart, Blue Cupidone, 
Blue Succory
Catanance has one sort with long leaves like those of
coronopis, a thin root, and six or seven rush-like
heads in which is seed similar to ervum [2-129, 2-131].
Withered, it bends down to the ground and is similar to
the claws of a dead kite [bird]. The other is the size of a
little apple; the root is small, about the size of an olive,
and the leaves similar in shape and colour to the olive,
but soft, scattered on the earth, and jagged. The small
seed (like cicer [2-126]) is found on the little stems, bored
through in many parts, a Phoenician colour [red]. Some
report that both kinds are good for liquid love medicines,
and they say that the Thessalian women use them. It is
also called damnamene, dionysias, thyrsion, demos, cemos, or
crotion; the Magi call it archaras, some, arcopus, the
Romans, herba filicula, some, datisca, or Iovis madius, and
the Dacians, caropithla.
4-135. TRIPOLION
SUGGESTED: Tripolium vulgare, Aster tripolium, Aster atticus 
— Tripoly, Sea Aster, Sea Starwort 
see 4-120
Tripolium grows in places near the sea where the sea
overflows and departs, neither is it in the dry, nor in
the sea. It has leaves similar to woad yet thicker, and a
stalk twenty centimetres long, jagged towards the top. It
is said that the flower of this changes its colour three
times a day — in the morning it is white, around noon,
purple, and in the evening, Phoenician [red]. The root is
white, sweet smelling, and hot to the taste. Two
teaspoonfuls of a decoction (taken as a drink in wine)
expel water and urine through the bowels. It is cut for
antidotes against poisons. It is also called psyche, meris,
potamogeton, or stachyites, and the Romans call it calamaris.

SUGGESTED: Adiantum foliis coriandri [Bauhin],
Adiantum capillus veneris [Fuchs, Linnaeus], 
Herba capillorum-veneris — Maidenhair, Venus’s Hair,
Capillaire 
Adiantum has little leaves similar to coriander, jagged
on the top; and the little stalks on which they grow
are black, very thin, twenty centimetres long, and
glistening. The leaves are like filix [fern], very small. It
bears no [other] stalk, flower, or seed. The root is useless.
A decoction of the herb (taken as a drink) is able to help
asthma, difficulty in breathing, jaundice, the splenical,
and frequent painful urination. Taken as a drink with
wine, it breaks stones [urinary, kidney], stops discharges
of the intestines, and helps those bitten by venomous
creatures, and excessive discharges of the stomach. It
draws out the menstrual flow and afterbirth. It stops the
spitting-up of blood. It is smeared on (raw) for venomous
beast bites, thickens the loss of hair [ alopecia] and
disperses tumours [possibly goitre]. With lye it wipes off
dandruff and scaly eruptions of the scalp. With ladanum
[1-128] and oil myrsinum [1-48] and inhalants (or else
oesypum [lanolin] and wine) it prevents falling hair. A
decoction of it (rubbed on with lye and wine) does the
same. It makes cocks and quails more vicious, mixed with
their meat. It is planted for sheep around sheep
enclosures [feed]. It grows in shady marshy places, and
around moist walls and fountains. It is also called
polytrichon, callitrichon, trichomanes, ebenotrichon, argion, or
coriandrum aquaticum ; the Egyptians call it epiert, the
Romans, cincinnalis, some, terrae capillus , or supercilium
terrae, and the Dacians, phithophthethela.
4-I37. TRICHOMANES
SUGGESTED: Trichomanes, Polytrichon officinarum, 
Asplenium viride [Fuchs], Asplenium trichomanes,

that mentioned before. Some also call this adiantum,
some, pterion, some, opteron, the Romans, capillaris, some,
pinula, some filicula.
4-I38. XANTHION
SUGGESTED: Xanthium, Lappa minor [Fuchs, Bauhin], 
Xanthium strumarium [Linnaeus] — Cocklebur [Mabberley]
Xanthium grows in fertile places and marshes that are
dried up; it has a cornered stalk a cubit long, clean, 
and many  stings upon it. It has leaves like atriplex [2-145],
having incuts, close in scent to nasturtium, but a round
fruit as a great olive, prickly, like the balls of the plane tree 
taking hold of clothes after you touch it. The fruit,
gathered before it is perfectly dry, beaten, and preserved
in a clay jar, is able to make hair yellow. To use it take a
quantity of half a sextary of it, diluting it with lukewarm
water, and having first rubbed the head with nitre, smear
it on. And some also beat it with wine to preserve it. The
fruit is expediently laid on oedema. Some call it
phasganon, some, antithesion, some, cbascanon, some,
choeradolethron, and some also call this aparine.
4-139. AIGILOPS
SUGGESTED: Aegilops ovata — Goat Grass, Hard Grass
Phleum aegylops, Triticum ovatum  — Hard Grass, Goat Grass,
Oat Grass
 Aegilops caudata [Loudon]— Cretan Hard Grass
Aegilops is a little herb with leaves similar to wheat,
but often with two or three red seeds on the top of
the head on which beards (or as it were, filaments) grow
out. The herb (applied with meal) heals aegilopses [ulcer
or fistula in the inner angle of the eye] and dissolves hard
lumps. The juice is stored for the same purposes, mixed
with meal, and dried. It is also called sitospelos, siphon, or
bromos, and the Romans call it avena.
 687

SUGGESTED: Bromus temulentus, Lolium temulentum, 
Crepolea temulentum — Darnel, Cheat, Ryegrass, Ivray 
NARCOTIC [Loudon]
[other usage] Bromus arvensis — Corn Brome Grass
see 2-116
Bromus is a drying herb similar to aegilops. Strain the
boiled herb with its roots in water until the decoction
is reduced two thirds, mix with it the same amount of
honey, and boil it until it is the thickness of moist honey.
This is good for ozaena [ ulcerative disease with muco-
purulent discharge of the nose] if you apply it to the
nostril with a wet a linen cloth, and applied alone it does
the same. Some beat aloes finely, mix it with bromus, and
use it. It is also good (boiled with dry roses in wine) for
stinking breath. It is also called siphonion, or acrospelos,
and the Romans call it avena.
4-141. GLAUX
SUGGESTED: Glaux maritima — Sea Milkwort, Black Saltwort
Glaux is similar in its leaves to cytisus [4-113] or lentils.
Those from beneath are paler, and those from above 
green, and it sends out five or six thin shoots from the
earth, twenty centimetres long, from the root. The
flowers are similar to leucoioi [3-138] but smaller, of a
purple colour. It grows by the sea. These (boiled with
barley meal, salt, and oil) are sipped to restore milk that
has stopped flowing [breastfeeding].
4-142. POLUGALON
SUGGESTED: Polygala vulgaris — Common Milkwort,
Milkweed 
Polygalon is a little shrub twenty centimetres long, with 
leaves similar to lentils, harsh to the taste. A
decoction (taken as a drink) is thought to cause more milk 
[breastfeeding].

 see 4-133
Osyris is a little black shrub, with thin hard-to-break
stems, and around each, three small leaves; there
are also four or five or six of these, like hemp; they are
black when they are beginning but later they become
reddish. A decoction of this (taken as a drink) helps
jaundice.
4-144. SMILAX TRACHEIA
SUGGESTED: Smilax-aspera [Fuchs, Linnaeus]
— Prickly Ivy, Rough Bindweed 
Smilax trachea  has leaves similar to periclymen [4-14],
with many sprigs, thin and prickly like paliurus or
rubus, and it is wrapped around trees creeping (as it were) 
above and beneath. It bears a clustered fruit like a grape
bunch, which ripens red, somewhat gently biting to the
taste; the root is hard and thick. It grows in marshy rough
places. A decoction of the leaves and fruit is an antidote
for deadly poisons, taken as a drink beforehand (or
afterwards). It is said that this herb, beaten and given to
drink to a newborn small child, prevents hurt by any
poisonous medicine. It is cut for antidotes against poison.
4-145. SMILAX LEIA
SUGGESTED: Smilax-levis, Volubilis maior [Fuchs], 
Convolvulus major albus [Bauhin], Convolvulus sepium
[Linnaeus], Calystegia sepium [Brunfels] — Bindweed 
Smilax laea  has leaves similar to cissus but softer,
smoother and thinner. It has vinelike branches like
the last one, without prickles, and it is wrapped around
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK
 691

trees like the former. It has small black seed like lupin
[2-132], but always with many small, round, white
flowers above, on every smilax. Arbors are made from it in 
the summer, but it sheds its leaves in the fall. Thirty
grains of the seed of this (taken as a drink with the same
amount of dorycnium [4-75]) is said to cause many
troublesome dreams.
4-146. MURSINE AGRIA
SUGGESTED: Myrtus communis var romana 
— Broad-leaved Myrtle 
[other usage] Myrsine africana — African Myrsine 
Myrsine has a leaf similar to myrtle but broader,
sharp at the top like a spear. The fruit is round and
borne in the centre of the leaves [[flattened stems], red
when ripe, with the inside bony. The little branches are
willow-like, many emerging out of the same root, and
hard to break, the length of a forearm, and full of leaves.
The root is like that of grass, harsh to the taste, somewhat
bitter. It grows in rough steep places. The leaves and
berries (taken as a drink in wine) are able to induce urine,
expel the menstrual flow, and break stones in the
bladder. It cures jaundice, slow painful urination, and
headaches. A decoction of the root (taken as a drink with
wine) does the same. The newly-grown stalks (used as
vegetables) are eaten instead of asparagus, but they are
bitter and diuretic. It is also called sacra myrtus, spinosa
myrtus, murina spina , agonon, scincos, minthe, catangelos,
anangelos, acairon, ocneron, cine, lichene, chamaepitys, or
chamaemyrsine; the Boeotians call it gurenia, the Magi,
genitura Herculis, and the Romans, ruscus.

Danaidea racemosa, Ruscus racemosus
Laurus Alexandrina has leaves similar to myrsine agria
but larger, softer and paler, with a red fruit in the
centre of them the size of a cicer [2-126]. The branches lie
on the earth, twenty centimetres long (or sometimes
more). The root is similar to myrsine agria but larger, with
a sweet scent, and softer. It grows in hilly places. Six
teaspoons of the root (taken as a drink with sweet wine) is 
able to help women in difficult labour [ childbirth], and
those with slow painful urination, and it extracts blood. It
is also called  idaea, danae, hypoglotton, zalaea, stephane,
daphnos, samothracica, methrion, or hypoglossion.

Daphne laureola, Daphne mezereum [Linnaeus], 
Thymelaea praecox, Thymelaea mezereum, Mezereum officinale 
— Spurge, Laurel, Dwarf Bay, Mezereon, Spurge Olive,
 Dwarf Laurel  
Daphnoeides is similar to alypon [4-180] with a flower
like nymphaea [3-148], and in the midst of this,
something  like a cone, in which is the seed. It is a little
shrub, a foot high, with many branches (flexible like a
thong), bearing leaves from the middle to the top. The
bark around the stems is very gluey; the leaves are similar 
to the bay, but softer, more slender, and not easily
broken, biting and burning the mouth and the jaws. The
flowers are white and the fruit black when it is grown
ripe; the root is useless. It grows in mountainous places.
The leaves (taken in a drink either dried or fresh) expel
phlegm through the bowels. It encourages vomiting and
the menstrual flow. Chewed, it draws mucus from the

head, and it also encourages sneezing, and a decoction of
as much as eleven grains of the fruit (taken as a drink)
purges. It is also called daphnitis, or hydragogon; the
Romans call it laureola, some, lactago, and the Gauls,
ousubim.
4-149. CHAMAIDAPHNE
SUGGESTED: Prunus laurocerasus [Pliny], Cerasus laurocerasus,
Padus laurocerasus, Laurocerasus officinalis 
— Dwarf Laurel, Cherry Laurel
Chamaedaphne sends out single-branched rods a foot
long — straight, thin and smooth; the leaves of this
are similar to the [other] bay but much smoother, thinner
and greener. The fruit is round and red, growing near to
the leaves. The leaves of this (pounded into small pieces
and smeared on) helps headaches and burning of the
stomach. They cease griping, taken as a drink with wine.
The juice (given to drink with wine) expels the menstrual
flow and urine, and applied in a pessary it does the same.
Some have called this alexandrina, daphnitis, or
hydragogon, the Romans, laureola, some lactago, and the
Gauls, ousubim.
4-150. ELLEBOROS
SUGGESTED: Elleborus-albus, Elleborus candidus [Fuchs], 
Veratrum album [Fuchs, Linnaeus], Helleborus albus 
— Hellebore, White Hellebore, Lungwort 
POISONOUS
Elleborus albus has leaves similar to those of plantain or
of the wild beet but shorter, darker, and red in
colour. The stalk is a hand’s width, hollow. It is peeled
when it begins to dry. The many thin roots are
underneath, coming out together from a small,
somewhat long little head like an onion. It grows in
rough hilly places. You must gather the roots at harvest
time. The best is that which is mildly extended, white,
easily broken and fleshy, not peaked, and like a rush (or
giving off down) when broken; but with the pith thin,
not burning the taste too much, nor drawing out spittle

too fast, for this sort is choking. The best is the Cyrenian
and the Galatian. The Cappadocian is paler, downy and
more choking. 
It purges by causing vomiting, expelling matter of
various colours. It is mixed with eye salves that are able to 
take away things that darken the pupils. It expels the
menstrual flow, is applied as an abortifacient, and
encourages sneezing. Kneaded with honey and polenta
and boiled to gether with pieces of meat, it kills mice and
decomposes them. It is given to those fasting either by
itself, or with sesame and barley water, alica [2-114],
honey water, porridge, lens [lentils], or some other
sipping liquid. It is also made into bread and baked like
wheat. The method of treatment and the dieting is fully
explained by those who by declaration have written
about the dosages of it. We most agree with Phlomides
the Sicilian from Enna. For it is tedious in discussing
medicinal matters, professedly to set down the
therapeutical institution. 
Some give it with a lot of sipping stuff or a great
quantity of juice, or else, giving beforehand some small
nourishment, they straight away give the hellebore to
one in whom (especially) choking is suspected, or who
has weakness of the body. The purging is without danger 
to those who take it like this, because the medicine is not
unseasonably applied to their bodies. Suppositories of it
(put up into the perineum with vinegar) encourage
vomiting.
It is also called ascis, atomon, or pignatoxaris; the Magi
call it genitura Herculis , some, polyides, or anaphytos; the
Egyptians call it somphia, some, unre, the Romans,
veratrum album, the Gauls, laginum, and some, anepsa.

Elleborus niger adulterinus sylvestris [Fuchs],
 Helleborus foetidus [Linnaeus] — Stinkwort [Mabberley]
[other usage] Astrantia major — Black Hellebore, Masterwort,
Larger Astrantia 
ALL POISONOUS
Helleborus niger  is called melampodium since it is
thought that one Melampus, a goatherd, purged
and cured the mad daughters of Proteus with it. It has
green leaves similar to the plane tree, but smaller, closer
to those of spondylium, more jagged, darker, and
somewhat rough. The stalk is rough, and the flowers
white, inclining to purple, and in clusters. In it is seed
similar to cnicus [4-119, 4-190] that those who live in
Anticyra call sesamoeides [4-152] and use for purges. The
roots underneath are thin and black, hanging (as it were)
on an onion-like little head, which also has use. It grows
in rough high dry places. The best is taken out of
countries such as Anticyra, for the blackest and best
grows there. Choose that which is fleshy and well
nourished with only thin pith, sharp and burning to the
taste, such as that in Helicon and Parnassus, and that
growing in Aetolia. That from Helicon is the best. 
It purges the intestines from above, driving out
phlegm and bile, given alone (or with scammony and a
teaspoonful or thirty grains of salt). It is also boiled with
lens [lentils] and broths that are taken for purging. It is
good for epilepsy, depression, delirium, arthritis and
paralysis. Given in a pessary it expels the menstrual flow,
is an abortifacient, and cleans fistulas [ulcers] (put into
them and taken away after the third day). Similarly, it is
put into the ears for those who are hard of hearing,
leaving it alone for two or three days. Rubbed on with
frankincense, or wax, pitch, and oil cedrinum [cedar], it
also heals parasitic skin diseases. Applied with vinegar it
heals vitiligo [type of leprosy], impetigo, and leprosy.
Boiled with vinegar and used as a mouthwash, it soothes
toothache. It is also put into corrosive medicines. With

barley meal and wine it is a good poultice for dropsy.
Planted near the roots of vines it makes the wine made
from them purgative. 
They sprinkle it around houses thinking it preserves
them from evil spirits. When they dig it they stand
praying to Apollo and Aesculapius, observing the eagle’s
flight, for they say he flies that way not without danger to 
them. For the bird causes death if one is seen digging
hellebore; and one must dig it with swiftness because
inhaling it causes a headache. To prevent this, those who
dig it eat garlic and drink wine, so they are made less
liable to be hurt. It is pithy, as is the white hellebore.
It is also called  melampodium, ectomon, polyrrhizon,
protion, melanorrhizon, or cyrranion; the Magi call it
zomarition, the Egyptians, isea, some, elaphine, or cemeleg,
the Romans, veratrum nigrum , some, saraca, and the
Dacians, prodiorna.
4-152. SESAMOEIDES
SUGGESTED: Sesamum triphyllum — Wild Sesame  
Hyptis spicigera — Black Sesame
ALSO: Sesamum indicum, Sesamum orientale
sesamoides means ‘like sesame’
The great sesamoides is a herb similar to senecio
[ragwort] or to rue [3-52, 3-53, 4-98] — the flower
white, the root slender and useless, the seed similar to
that of sesama [2-121], bitter to the taste — which purges
both phlegm and bile upward. It is pounded into small
pieces and taken with fifteen grains of white hellebore
with honey and water. It is also called sesamites, or
sesamis, lupina scutica, white hellebore, or anticyricon. In
Anticyra they call it hellebore because it is mixed in the
purges with white hellebore.
4-153. SESAMOEIDES MIKRON
SUGGESTED: Sesamum triphyllum — Wild Sesame  
Hyptis spicigera — Black Sesame
The small sesamoides has small stalks twenty
centimetres long, with leaves similar to coronopis, yet
rougher and smaller. On top of the little stalks are small
 703
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

heads, with somewhat purple little flowers, the middle of 
which is white, in which is seed similar to sesama [2-121],
bitter and yellowish. The root is thin. Half an acetabulum
[vinegar cruet] of a decoction of the seed (taken as a drink 
with honey water) purges bile and phlegm downwards.
Applied with water it dissolves small swellings and
oedema. It grows in rough places. It is also called coronion, 
or sylvestre sesamon.
4-154. SIKUS AGRIOS 
SUGGESTED: Sicyos agrios [Apuleius], Cucumis sylvestris,
Cucumer asininus [Fuchs], Ecballium elaterium,
 Ecballium agreste, Momordica elaterium [Linnaeus], 
Elaterium officinale [in Sprague] — Wild Cucumber,
Squirting Cucumber
POISONOUS
Sucus agria differs from the cultivated sucus in the fruit,
having them much smaller, similar to somewhat long
little suppositories. The leaves and shoots are similar to
the cultivated. The root is white. It grows in the rubbish of 
houses and in sandy places. The shrub is bitter. 
The juice of the leaves dropped in the ears is good for
earache, and the root (smeared on with polenta)
dissolves all old oedemas. Applied with resin terminthos
[1-91] it breaks small swellings. Boiled with vinegar (and
smeared on) it dissolves gout, and is a suppository for
sciatica, and a decoction is a mouthrinse for toothache.
Pounded into small pieces (when it has dried) it cleanses
vitiligines [form of leprosy], leprosy, and impetigo [skin
infection], and purifies black scars and spots on the face.
Fifteen grains (at the least) of the juice of the root (and as
much as the fourth part of an acetabulum [vinegar cruet]
of the bark) also purge phlegm and bile (especially in
dropsy) but without hurting the stomach. One must take
a half a pound of the root, beat it finely with two pints of
wine (especially Libyan wine) and give a quarter pint
(every third day) until the swelling is sufficiently
reduced. It is also called  elaterium, grynon, balis, syncrisis,
bubalion, scopion, imbriferum, peucedanon, or notion; the
Romans call it agtetum, some, agrestis, and the Africans,
cusimezar.

SUGGESTED: Sicyos agrios [Apuleius], Cucumis sylvestris,
Cucumer asininus [Fuchs], Ecballium elaterium,
Ecballium agreste, Momordica elaterium [Linnaeus], 
Elaterium officinale [in Sprague] — Wild Cucumber,
 Squirting Cucumber
POISONOUS
Elaterium is made (as follows) from the fruit of the
cucumber. Choose cucumbers that spring back when 
touched, lay them aside, leaving them for a night. Then
the next day set a loosely woven sarce [strainer] over a jar,
and with a little knife held in place with the edge
upward, take the cucumbers one by one with both hands, 
cut them, and strain out the liquid through the sarce
[strainer] into the little jar that stands underneath, also
straining out the purple stuff which adheres to the sarce
[strainer] so that it may also pass through. Put that which
has been strained into a basin standing by, then lay
together the cut stuff on the cloth, moisten it with fresh
water, strain it, and throw the remainder away. Having
stirred the liquid around in the basin, cover it with a linen 
cloth, set it in the sun, and after a while pour away all the
water that swims on top (with any coalesced matter). Do
this often, as long as any water remains standing on top,
which you clear out by drops. Placing the sediment into a
mortar, pound it and make it into tablets. So that the
liquid may be quickly dried up, some sprinkle sifted
ashes on the ground, and hollowing their midst, spread
over it a doubled linen cloth, pour in the elaterium, and
when it has dried, they beat it in a mortar (as previously
mentioned). Some (instead of fresh water) wash it by
pouring on seawater. Some (in the last washing) pour on
honey and water. The best elaterium has a rather moist
whiteness, is light, smooth, extremely bitter to the taste,
and applied to a candle is soon kindled. But that which
resembles leeks and is coarse and foul to the sight, full of
ervum [2-129, 2-131] and ashes, is heavy and useless.
Some also mix starch with the juice of cucumber to make
it white and light. 
That which is two years old is good for purging (until
it is ten). The perfect dose is ten grains, the least five
grains, and for children, two aureola (?). If more is taken
 707
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

(as a drink) it is dangerous. It induces purging both
downward and upward, expelling phlegm and bile. This
purging is best for difficult breathers. If you want to
purge the intestines downward mix it with twice as much 
salt, and stibium [trisulphide of antimony or black
antimony] as much as to colour it, give pills as big as
ervum [seed] formed with water, and let him sip them
with one winecupful of lukewarm water. For vomiting,
dilute the elaterium in water and rub under the tongue
with a feather, as far in as possible. If he finds it difficult to 
vomit, dilute it either in oil or ointment irinum [1-66], but
forbid him to sleep. To those who are excessively purged
you must frequently give oiled wine, for this way the
vomiters are restored. If the vomiting does not cease cold
water must be given with polenta, posca [hot drinks], and
an apple, and other things to thicken the stomach.
Elaterium (used in a pessary) induces the menstrual flow,
and is an abortifacient. Poured with milk into the nostrils
it cleans away jaundice, and drives away long-lasting
headaches. It is an effective ointment (with old oil, honey, 
or a bull’s gall) for a synanchic [ abscessed] throat. A
teaspoon of the root of cultivated cucumber (pounded
into small pieces and taken as a drink with honey water)
induces vomiting, but if anyone wants to vomit gently
after supper, twenty grains are sufficient.
4-156. STAPHISAGRIA 
SUGGESTED: Staphisagria, Staphis agria [Fuchs, Bauhin]
 Delphinium staphisagria [Linnaeus], Pedicularis palustris 
— Stavesacre, Lousewort
POISONOUS
Staphis agria  has leaves like the wild vine — jagged,
straight, soft and black, with little stalks; and it bears a 
flower similar to glastum [2-215, 2-216]. The seed is in little
pods, green, like cicer [2-126], triangular, coarse, a tawny
yellow and black. That within is white and sharp to the
taste. If you give ten or fifteen grains of this (pounded in
honey and water) it purges thick stuff by vomiting, but let 
them walk about who have taken a drink of it. You must
be careful when giving it in honey water because of the
danger of suffocation and burning the jaws. It is good
bruised and rubbed on with oil for pthiriases [psoriasis],

itches, and parasitical skin diseases. Chewed, it brings up
a lot of phlegm, and boiled with vinegar for a mouthwash 
it helps toothache. This also represses rheumatic gums.
With honey it heals apthas [small ulcers] in the mouth,
and it is mixed with warm compresses for burns. It is also
called trifolium, stesium, astaphis, phthiroctonon, phthirion,
apanthropon, polyides, pseudopathes, or arsenote; the
Egyptians call it ibesaoide, and the Romans, herba
pedicularis.
4-157. THAPSIA
SUGGESTED: Thapsia garganica — Thapsia, Drias Plant,
 Smooth Thapsia 
 Thapsia villosa, Thapsia foetida, Thapsia asclepium 
— Deadly Carrot species 
Thapsia is named because it is thought that it was first
found in Thapsus, an island of the same name. The
whole nature of it is similar to ferula [3-95]. The stalk is
more slender, the leaves similar to marathrum [3-81], and
on the top at every emergence are tufts similar to dill
[3-67] on which are yellowish flowers. The seed is
somewhat broad, similar to that of ferula, yet smaller. The
large root is white within and black outside, thickly
barked, and sharp. This has its liquid taken by being dug
around and having the bark cut in. Or else the root itself
is made hollow like a house roof, broad beneath and
narrow at last, and then sealed so that the liquid may
remain pure. Then the next day after you must go there
and take away the liquid that has gathered together. It is
juiced — the root is pounded and strained through a
wicker colander and a press — and the juice dried in the
sun in a thick ceramic jar. Some bruise with it its leaves
but this sort is weak. The juice of the root is discerned by
its stronger scent and by remaining moist, but that of the
leaves is dry and wormeaten. 
It is necessary for one who takes the liquid not to
stand against the wind but rather to do it in still weather,
for it puffs up the face excessively, and the naked parts
are blistered by the sharpness of the exhalation. He ought 
therefore first to rub his naked parts with moist,
astringent, stiff ointments and then take it. The bark of
the root, juice, and liquid are purging (a decoction is
 711
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

taken as a drink with honey and water), for they purge
bile upward and downward. Forty grains of the root is
given with three teaspoonfuls of dill seed; and thirty
grains of the juice or ten grains of the liquid, for it is
dangerous if more is given. This purging is good for
asthmatic disorders, long-lasting pains of the sides, and
expectorants, but for those who find it hard to vomit it is
given in meats and sauces. The liquid and roots,
especially those of equal strength, are able to eliminate
waste, whether to draw out anything from far within, or
alter the state of the pores. Thus the juice rubbed on, or
the green root rubbed on, thickens loss of hair [alopecia].
The root pounded into small pieces, or the juice with
frankincense and wax (an equal measure of each) takes
away bruises and blue marks. It must be left on no longer
than two hours, and after this bathe the place with warm
seawater. Smeared on with honey it takes away sunburn,
and removes leprosy. The juice rubbed on with sulphur
breaks tubercula [nodules]. It is rubbed on to benefit those
who have long-lasting disorders of the side, lungs, feet,
or joints. It is also useful for replacing the foreskin on
those who lack the foreskin that was not done by
circumcision, by forming a tumour that, washed and
softened with fat things, fills up the defect of the foreskin.
It is also called  hypopion, pancranon, scammonion, or
thelyteris, the Romans call it ferulago, some, ferula
sylvestris, and the Africans, boide. 
4-158. SPARTION 
SUGGESTED: Spartus [Fuchs], Spartium junceum [Linnaeus]
— Spanish Broom, Spart Grass, Spartum
Spartium is a shrub with long stems without leaves,
strong, hard to break, with which they bind vines. It
bears pods like phaseoli [2-130], in which are little seeds
like lentils, and the flower is yellowish like leucoion
[3-138]. A decoction of fifty grains of the seed of this with
its flowers (taken as a drink with honey and water)
purges upward with violence like hellebore, yet without
danger. The seed induces purging downwards. The
stems (steeped in water then pounded and juiced) help
sciatica and abscessed throat, as much as a winecupful

Vitis nigra

taken as a drink while fasting. Some steep it in brine or
seawater as suppositories for sciatica, for it expels bloody
and strimentous stuff. It is also called lobon, or lygon.
4-159. SILUBON
SUGGESTED: Spina alba hortensis, Carduus mariae [Fuchs,
Brunfels], Carduus albus maculis [Bauhin], Silybum marianum, 
Carduus marianus [Linnaeus] — Milk Thistle,
 St Mary's Thistle 
Silybum is a broad acantha with leaves like white
chamaeleon [3-10], which is eaten newly sprung-up
[vegetable] boiled with oil and salt. The juice of the root
(as much as a teaspoonful taken as a drink with honey
and water) encourages vomiting. 
4-160. BALANOS AUREPSIKE
SUGGESTED:  Myrobalan citrina, Terminalia citrina 
— Hara Nut Tree 
Balanites aegyptica, Xymenia aegyptica — Thorn Tree,
 Egyptian Balsam, Zachum Oil Tree 
balanos aurepsike — acorns which are plucked
Balanum auripsike  is the fruit of a tree like myrica,
similar to hazelnut. That within is pressed like bitter
almonds, and it yields a liquid that they use for precious
ointments instead of oil. It grows in Ethiopia, Egypt,
Arabia, and in Petra, a town in Judaea. That which is new, 
full, white, and easily peeled is the best. This, pounded
into small pieces and a teaspoonful taken in a drink with
posca [hot drinks] reduces the spleen, and it is also laid on
it with lolium [2-116, 4-140] meal. It is used with honey
and water on gout. Boiled with vinegar it raises out
scabies [itchy parasitical disease] and leprosy. It is used
with saltpetre [potassium nitrate] for vitiligines [form of
leprosy] and black scars. With urine it takes away
freckles, varicose veins, sunburn, and pustules on the
face. With honey water it induces vomiting, and loosens
the intestines, but is very bad for the stomach. The oil
(taken as a drink) is astringent to the bowels. The bark is
 715
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

more astringent. The dregs that are left from that which
was pounded and strained out are mixed with sebaceous
treatments for roughness and itchiness. 
4-161. NARKISSOS
SUGGESTED: Narcissus pseudo-narcissus, Narcissus sylvestris 
— Wild Narcissus, Daffodil, Lent Lily, Lent Rose
 Narcissus poeticus — Poet’s Narcissus, Pheasant’s Eye
Narcissus has similar leaves to the leek. They are
thinner, much smaller, and narrower. It has an
empty stalk without leaves, longer than twenty
centimetres; on which is a white flower, and within a
saffron colour and in some, a purple colour. The root is
white within, round, bulbus-like [2-200]; the seed is in a
little skin, black, somewhat long. The best grows in hilly
places and has a good scent, but the rest is leekish and has 
an herby smell. The root of this (eaten or taken in a drink)
induces vomiting. It is good also for burns, beaten small
with honey. Laid on, it joins cut-apart sinews. Beaten
finely and laid on with honey it helps dislocations of
joints, and long-lasting pains of the joints. With nettle
seed and vinegar it cleans sunburn and vitiligo [type of
leprosy]. With ervum [2-129, 2-131] and honey it purges
the filth of ulcers, and breaks the hard ripening of boils;
and laid on with lolium meal [2-116, 4-140] and honey it
draws out splinters. Some also have called it lirium, as
they do the lily. It is also called narcissus anydros,
autogenes, bulbus vomitorius, or lirion, and the Romans call
it bulbus morbitarius.
4-162. IPPOPHAES
SUGGESTED: Hippophae rhamnoides — Sallow Thorn, 
Willow Thorn, Sea Buckthorn 
Hippophaes with which they tread or beat cloth to
thicken it, grows in sandy maritime places. It is a
thick spriggy shrub, placing out on all sides; with long
leaves similar to those of the olive, but narrower and
softer; and between them dry filaments, whitish, knotty,
distant from one another. The flowers are like clusters of
berries of cissus [2-210], like clusters of grapes lying upon

one another, but smaller and soft, and with the white
inclining to a Phoenician [red] colour in part. The root is
thick and soft, full of liquid, bitter to the taste, and has its
liquid taken like thapsia [4-157]. The liquid is stored alone
or mixed with meal of ervum [2-129, 2-131] and dried. It
purges bilious, watery and phlegmy matter downwards,
as much as ten grains of it, unmixed. Of that mixed with
the ervum, use forty grains with honey and water. The
shrub is dried with its roots, pounded into small pieces,
and given with a half-pint of honey and water. A juice is
made of the root and herb like thapsia. For purging a
teaspoonful of this is given. Some call it hippophues,
hippophanes, hippion, equinum, or pelecinos; the Romans call 
it lappago, and some, lappolamera.
4-163. IPPOPHAISTON
SUGGESTED: Tithymalus diffusis, Euphorbia spinosa
 [Bedevian] — Hippophaiston
Hippophaeston grows in the same places in which
hippophaes [above] grows, also a kind of fuller’s
acantha [thistle] but it lies on the ground. It has only small
little leaves, with empty little prickly heads. It bears
neither stalk nor flower, and a thick soft root. Juice the
leaves, root and head of this, dry the juice, and give thirty
grains with honey and water to whom you will for
purging to expel water and phlegm. This purging is good
for asthma, epilepsy, and disorders of the strength. Some
also call this hippophaes.
4-164. KROTON E KIKI
SUGGESTED: Ricinus [Fuchs], Ricinus vulgaris [Bauhin],
Ricinis communis [Linnaeus] — Castor Bean Plant
[other usage]Croton tiglium, Croton acutus, Croton jamalgota,
Pavana, Tiglium officinalis — Croton Oil Plant, 
Purging Croton, Tiglium 
Croton is named for the similarity of the seed to the
kroton tick. It is a tree the height of a small fig tree,
with leaves like the plane tree, but bigger, smoother and
blacker. It has trunks and boughs hollow like a reed; and
 719
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

the seed in rough berries, which peeled are like the
kroton tick. Out of these is pressed the oil called cicinum
[1-38]. It is not eaten but is useful for candles and plasters.
Thirty grains, cleaned, pounded into small pieces, and
taken in a drink drives out phlegm, bile, and water
through the bowels. They also induce vomiting, but this
purging is harsh and extremely drastic, overturning the
stomach excessively. Pounded and applied it cleans
varicose veins and sunburn. The leaves (bruised with
flour of polenta and applied alone or with vinegar) lessen 
oedema and inflammation of the eyes, reduce breasts
swollen from milk, and extinguish erysipela [streptococcal 
skin infection]. Crotona some call sesamum sylvestre, seseli
cyprium, or croton; the Egyptians call it systhamna, some,
trixis, the Magi, sanguis febris , the Romans, ricinus, and
some, lupa.
4-165. TITHUMALOS 
SUGGESTED: Euphorbia resinifera —  Euphorbium Gum Plant
 Euphorbia tithymaloides, Pedilanthus tithymaloides
— Red Bird Cactus, Slipper Flower, Jew Bush 
 Tithymalus diffusis, Euphorbia spinosa — Hippophaiston
 Euphorbia — Devil’s Milk, Spurge 
 Tithymalus acutifolius, Euphorbia pithyusa,
 Tithymalus pithyusa — Pithyusa 
 Tithymalus peplis, Euphorbia peplis — Wild Purslane, 
Petty Spurge, Purple Spurge 
Tithumalos — milky white juice 
There are seven kinds of tithymal: the male is called
characias, comatus, or amygdaloides, or else it is called
gobius. Another is called female, myrtites, caryites, or
myrsinites; the third, paralius, or tithymalis; the fourth,
helioscopius; the fifth, cyparissias; the sixth, dendroides; and
the seventh, platyphyllos. 
4-165a. TITHUMALOS CHARACHIAS
SUGGESTED: Euphorbia characias [Loudon]
Characias has red stalks over a foot high full of sharp
white juice. The leaves about the stems are like the
olive tree only longer and narrower. The root is thick and
 720
BOOK FOUR: OTHER HERBS & ROOTS

woody. On the top of the stalks are prickles of rushlike
little rods; and under them hollow cases like basins or
little hives in which is the seed. It grows in rough hilly
places. Twenty grains of the juice (taken with posca [hot
drinks]) purges the bowels below, expelling phlegm and
bile. With honey and water it induces vomiting. It is
juiced about the time of vintage, the stems laid together
and cut. They must be shut up in a jar. Some mix it with
meal of ervum [2-129, 2-131] to form pills the size of ervum
[seed]. Some drop three or four drops into dried figs and
dry them and store them. Pounded alone in a mortar it is
formed into pills and put in jars. When juicing one must
not stand against the wind, nor put his hands to his eyes,
but also before juicing he must rub his body with grease
or oil and wine — especially the face, neck and scrotum. It 
irritates a sore throat, so he ought to wrap the pills in wax
or boiled honey and then give it. Two or three dried
impregnated figs (taken) are sufficient to purge. The
newly made juice (smeared on with oil in the sun) takes
off hair, and makes those which come up again yellow
and thin, and in the end destroys them all. It is put into
the cavities of teeth, lessening the pain. You must cover
the teeth with wax so that running beside it does not hurt
the sore throat or the tongue. Smeared on, it takes away
protruding and hanging warts, warty abnormal growths, 
and lichen [papular skin disease]. It is good for pterygium
[membrane on eye], and carbuncles [infected boils]
[malignant skin tumours], rapidly spreading ulcers,
gangrene, and fistulas [ulcers]. The seed is gathered in
the autumn, dried in the sun, pounded gently, the chaff
removed, and stored clean; and the leaves are dried the
same way. Half an acetabulum [vinegar cruet] of both the
seed and the leaves (given to drink) does the same things
as the juice. Some pickle them, mixing lepidium [2-205]
and bruised cheese with the milky juice. One teaspoonful 
of the root (sprinkled upon with honey water and taken
as a drink) purges through the belly. [The same] boiled
with vinegar and the teeth washed with it helps
toothache. 
 721
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

4-165b. TITHUMALOS MURSINITES
SUGGESTED: Euphorbia myrsinites [Loudon]
Myrsinites — a precious stone that smells like Myrrh [Pliny] — also Myrtle wine
The female (which some have called myrsinites or
caryites) is similar to daphnoeides, and has leaves like
myrsine (1-155, 4-146) but bigger and strong, sharp and
prickly on the top. It sends out shoots twenty centimeters 
long from the root, and every second year it bears a fruit
like a nut, gently biting to the tongue. This grows in
rough places. The juice, root, seed and leaves have similar 
uses to that above, yet that is stronger for a vomit. 
4-165c. TITHUMALOS KUPARISSIOS
SUGGESTED: Tithymalus cyparissias [Fuchs, Bauhin],
Euphorbia cyparissias [Loudon] — Cypress Spurge
[Mabberley]
Cyparissias sends out a somewhat red stalk twenty
centimeters long (or rather longer) out of which
spring leaves like those of the pine, yet more tender and
thinner. It is wholly like a pine newly come up, from
which it is named. This is also filled with white juice. It
has the same properties as those above.
4-165d. TITHUMALOS ELIOSKOPIOS
SUGGESTED: Tithymalus helioscopius [Fuchs, Bauhin],
 Euphorbia helioscopia [Linnaeus] — Wartwort, Wartgrass,
 Sun Spurge, Cat's Milk
Helioscopius has leaves like portulaca [4-168] but
thinner and rounder, and it sends out four or five
branches from the root, twenty centimeters long, thin
and red, full of quantities of white juice. The head is
dill-like [3-67], and the seed (as it were) in little heads, the
filaments of which are carried around by the course of the 
sun, from which it is called helioscopius. It grows in ruined
places and around towns. The juice and seed are
gathered like the others. They have the same properties
as those above but are not as forcible. 
 722
BOOK FOUR: OTHER HERBS & ROOTS

4-165e. TITHUMALOS PARALIOS
SUGGESTED: Euphorbia paralias — Sea Spurge
Tithymalus paralios grows in maritime places. It has five 
or six upright branches twenty centimetres long,
somewhat red, emerging from the root. Around these are 
small leaves, somewhat slender, quite long, like flax; and
on the top of each branch is a round head in which is seed 
like ervum [2-129, 2-131], variegated with white flowers.
The whole shrub and root are full of white juice and the
use and storage of this is like those above. Some have
called it tithymalis, or mecona.
4-165f. TITHUMALOS DENDRITES
SUGGESTED: Euphorbia dendroides — Tree-like Spurge
Dendroides grows on rocks, abundantly leafy towards
the top, and full of filaments and juice, with reddish 
branches, around which are thin leaves like myrtle [1-155, 
4-146]. The seed is like that of caracia [? Phaseolus caracalia]
and this is also stored in the same way and works like that 
mentioned above. 
4-165g. TITHUMALOS PLATUPHULLOS
SUGGESTED: Tithymalus platyphyllos [Fuchs], 
Euphorbia platyphyllos [Linnaeus] — Annual Warty Spurge
Platyphyllos is like verbascum [4-104]. The roots and
leaves purge watery matter through the bowels.
Pounded and diluted with water it kills fish and those
mentioned above do the same. 
4-166. PITUOUSA 
SUGGESTED: Tithymalus acutifolius, Euphorbia pithyusa,
Tithymalus pithyusa — Pithyusa
Pityusa sends out a stalk longer than a foot, very
knotted, surrounded with sharp thin little leaves like
those of pine flowers, small, and as it were, purple. The
 723
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

seed is broad like lentils; the root (which they call turpeth)
is white, thick, and full of juice. This shrub is found
considerably large in some places. Two teaspoonfuls of
the root (given with honey water) purges downward.
One teaspoonful of the seed (and as much as a spoonful
of the juice) is taken with meal in a catapotium [pill] but
three teaspoonfuls of the leaves are given.  
It is also called clema, crambion, paralion, or canopicon,
and seems to differ from the Cyparissian tithymal,
although it is considered one of them.
4-167. LATHUROS
SUGGESTED: Lathyris [Fuchs], Lathyris major [Bauhin], 
Euphorbia lathyris [Linnaeus], Euphorbia lathyrus,
Euphorbia spongiosa — Wild Caper, Myrtle Spurge,
 Caper Spurge
Lathyris sends out an empty stalk the height of a foot,
the thickness of a finger, and on the top of it are
wings. The leaves on the stalk are somewhat long like
those of the almond tree, but broader and smoother.
Those on the tops of the little branches are smaller, like
those of aristolochia [3-4, 3-5, 3-6] or of cissus [2-210]. It has
seed on the tops of the branches in three heads, round
like capparis [2-204], in which are three little seeds
separated by loose skins from one another, round, bigger
than ervum [2-129, 2-131]. Peeled, they are white and
sweet to the taste. The root is thin and white, of no use.
The whole shrub is full of juice like tithymal. As many as
seven or eight of the seeds are able to purge the bowels
taken in a pill or eaten and swallowed down with dry figs 
or dates, and cold water sipped with it. It expels phlegm,
bile, and water. The juice (taken like tithymal) does the
same. The leaves are boiled together with a hen or
vegetables for the same effect. Some also call this tithymal
and regard it among the tithymals.

4-168. PEPLOS
SUGGESTED: Peplos, Esula rotunda [Fuchs], Euphorbia peplus
[Linnaeus],  Tithymalus peplis, Euphorbia peplis
— Wild Purslane, Purple Spurge, Petty Spurge 
Peplos is a little shrub full of white juice, with a little
leaf like rue [3-52, 3-53, 4-98], but broader. The whole
clump is about twenty centimetres round, spread on the
ground; and under the leaves is little seed, round, smaller 
than that of white poppy. The herb has much use
although the single root (from which the whole shrub
breaks out) is of no use. It grows in gardens and
vineyards. It is gathered at harvest time, dried in the
shade, and turned often. The seed is pounded, made
clean, and stored. An acetabulum [vinegar cruet] of a
decoction (taken as a drink with a half pint of honey
water) expels phlegm and bile. Mixed in meats it disturbs
the digestion. It is preserved in brine. It is also called syce,
or papaver spumeum.
4-169. PEPLION
SUGGESTED: Peplis portula — Common Water Purslane 
Peplis grows (particularly) in maritime places. It is a
shrub spread around, full of white juice, with leaves
like garden portulaca [4-168] but round, with the parts
beneath a reddish colour; and round seed under the
leaves like peplus [4-168], hot to the taste. The single root is 
thin and useless. It is gathered, stored, and given like
peplus preserved in brine, and it has the same properties.
It is also called portulaca sylvestris, while Hippocrates calls
it peplion.
4-170. CHAMAISUKE
SUGGESTED: Euphorbia chamaesyce, Euphorbia massilensis  
— Crenated Annual Spurge
see 3-96
Chamaesyce sends out branches four fingers long,
lying upon the ground, round in a circle, full of juice, 
 725
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

with leaves like lens [lentils], similar to peplus [above],
little, thin, close to the earth. The seed is under the leaves,
round, like peplus. It has neither flower nor stalk, and the
root is thin and useless. The branches (pounded into
small pieces) with wine are able to lessen pains about the
womb. Applied as a pessary and smeared on they take
away oedema, hanging warts, and myrmecias [wart
resembling an anthill]. Eaten boiled, they loosen the
bowels, and the juice does the same things. Furthermore,
smeared on, it helps a scorpion strike. It is good rubbed
on with honey for dullness of sight, darkening of the
vision, new liquid discharges from the eyes, scars, and
specks or small clouds in the eye. It grows in dry rocky
places. Some call it syce, or papaver spumeum.
4-171. SKAMMONIA
SUGGESTED: Convolvulus scammonia, Convolvulus syriacus 
—  Scammony
gum resin 
Scamonia sends out many branches three feet long
from one fat root, displaying roughness; and the
leaves are also rough like helxine [4-39, 4-86] or cissus
[2-210], yet softer and triangular. The flowers are white,
round, hollow like baskets, with a strong scent. The root
is a good length, thick as an arm, white, with a strong
scent, and full of juice. The juice is gathered as follows:
the head is taken away from the root and a roof-like
hollowness cut into it; the juice flows into it and is taken
up in spoons. Some dig the earth in a roof-like shape,
place leaves of the carya [1-178] underneath, and pour the 
juice on them. When it has dried to a resin they take it
away. The good resin is transparent, light, thin, and like
bull glue in colour, with thin fungus-like cracks, like that
from Mysia in Asia. Do not only look for the whiteness of
it when touched by the tongue, for this happens also if
the juice of tithymal [above] is mixed with it, but look
rather to the signs previously mentioned, and also that it
does not burn the tongue too much, which happens
when tithymal is mixed with it. Those made in Judaea and 
the Syrian are the worst — heavy, thick, adulterated with
tithymal and ervum meal [2-129, 2-131]. 
 726
BOOK FOUR: OTHER HERBS & ROOTS

Forty grains of the juice (taken with honey and water
or a teaspoon of water) is able to purge bile and phlegm
downwards. To loosen the bowels twenty grains are
enough, taken with sesama [2-121] or some other seed. For 
more effective purging thirty grains of the juice is given
with twenty grains of black hellebore and one
teaspoonful of aloe. Purging salts are prepared with
twenty teaspoonfuls of the juice of scammony mixed
with six cups of salt. It is taken according to the strength
of a man. The full dose is three spoonfuls, the middle two
and the least one. One or two teaspoonfuls of the root
(mixed with the things previously mentioned) are a
purge. Some boil it and drink it. Boiled with vinegar and
pounded into small pieces with barley meal it is a poultice 
for sciatica. The juice (applied to the womb in wool) is an
abortifacient. Rubbed on with honey or oil it dissolves
tubercula [nodules]. Boiled in vinegar and smeared on it
takes away leprosy. With vinegar and rosaceum [1-53] it
makes irrigations [by pouring or sprinkling] for a
long-lasting headache.
Some call this scamboniae radix, colophonia, or dactylium, 
the Romans call it colophonium, the Magi, apopleumonos,
and the Egyptians, sanilum.
4-172. CHAMELAIA
SUGGESTED: Chamelaea [Pliny], Cneorum tricoccon 
— Dwarf Olive 
 Cneorum [Bedevian] — Spurge Olive, Widow Wail 
Chamelaea has branches twenty centimetres long. The
shrub is sprigged, and it has leaves like the olive but
more slender, thick and bitter, biting to the taste, and
irritating to the throat. The leaves of this purge phlegm
and bile downward, especially taken in a catapotium [pill]
with twice as much wormwood [3-26] mixed to one part
of the chamelaea, but let it be made with water or honey
into a catapotium. They are not soluble for they pass
through as big as they were taken. The leaves (pounded
into small pieces and taken with honey) purge foul,
crusted ulcers. It is also called pyros achne, acnestos, coccos
cnidios, chamelaea nigra, heraclion, or bdelura, the Romans
call it citocacium, and some, eleago, or oloastellum.

4-173. THUMELAIA
SUGGESTED: Thymelaea hirsuta, Daphne gnidium 
— Gnidium, Spurge Flax, Flax-leaved Daphne
[Loudon] not the cnidium species of today
Thymelaea is similar in nature to sown flax. It sends out
many thin fair stems, almost two feet high. The
leaves are like chamelaea [above] but narrower and fatter,
somewhat viscous and glutinous if chewed. The flowers
are white, and in the midst is the fruit — as small as that
of myrtus [1-155], round, at first green, but afterwards red. 
The covering of it is hard and black, but within it is white.
A decoction of the inner part (taken as a drink using as
much as twenty of the grains) purges bile, phlegm and
water downwards. It burns a rough throat; as a result it is
given with meal, polenta, in the kernel of a grape, or
covered with boiled honey to swallow it down.
Additionally, to rub those who have difficulty sweating,
it is pounded into small pieces with saltpetre [potassium
nitrate] and vinegar. The leaves — which are properly
called cneoron — must be gathered at harvest time and
put in jars after they have dried in the shade. It is
necessary to beat them and to take off the strings in them.
As much as an acetabulum [vinegar cruet] applied with
diluted wine purges by drawing away watery matter. It
makes the purging more moderate if it is mixed with
boiled lens [lentils] and bruised vegetables. They are
pounded into small pieces and made into little balls (with
juice from unripe grapes) to be stored. The herb is
worthless for the stomach, and given as a pessary it is an
abortifacient. It grows in rough hilly places. Some are
deceived thinking cnidium grain [seed] to be the fruit of
chamelaea, beguiled by the similarity of the leaves. It is also 
called chamelaea, pyrosachne, cestron, or cneoron. Cnidium
grain — which is the seed — is gathered, which the
Euboeans call it aetolium, the Syrians, apolinum, and some, 
linum.

4-174. AKTE
SUGGESTED: Sambucus [Fuchs], Sambucus nigra [Linnaeus]
— Elder Tree, Arn Tree, Boon Tree
see uses below — 4-175
Acte has two types; one is like a tree with reed-like
branches — round, hollow, whitish and a good
length. The three or four leaves are set at distances
around the stem, like the carya [1-178], more jagged, and
with a strong smell. On the top are branches or stalks on
which are round tufts with white flowers, and a fruit like
terminthos [1-91] of a somewhat purplish black, growing
in clusters, full of juice, smacking of wine. It is also called
arbor ursi, or sativa; the Romans call it sambucus, the Gauls, 
scobie, and the Dacians, seba.
4-175. CHAMAIAKTE
SUGGESTED: Ebulus [Fuchs], Sambucus ebulus [Linnaeus]
— Dwarf Elder, Ground Elder, Danewort 
BERRIES POISONOUS
The other kind is called chamaiacte. This has a creeping
rhizome and is smaller and more herb-like, with a
foursquare stalk that has many joints. The leaves are
spread out at distances around every joint, like the
almond tree, cut-in all around, and longer, with a strong
scent, and having a tuft on the top like that above, and
with a similar flower and fruit. The long root lies
underneath, the thickness of a finger. This has the same
properties and uses as that above — drying, expelling
water, yet bad for the stomach. The leaves (boiled as
vegetables) purge phlegm and bile, and the stalks (boiled
as a vegetable) do the same. The roots (boiled with wine
and given with meat) are good for dropsy. A decoction
(taken as a drink) helps those bitten by vipers. Boiled
with water for bathing it softens the womb and opens the
vagina, and sets to rights any disorders around it. A
decoction of the fruit (taken as a drink with wine) does
the same things, and rubbed on it darkens the hair. The
new tender leaves (smeared on with polenta) lessen
inflammation, and smeared on, they are good for burns
 729
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

and dog bites. Smeared on with bull or goat grease they
heal hollow ulcers, and help gout. It is also called
heliosacte, sylvestris sambucus, or euboica; the Romans call it
ebulus, the Gauls, ducone, and the Dacians, olma.
4-176. PUKNOKOMON
SUGGESTED: Clinopodium vulgare, Melissa clinopodium 
— Wild Basil 
see 3-50, 3-109
Pycnocomon has leaves like eruca [2-170] but rough,
thick, and sharper, a four-square stalk, and a flower
like that of basil. The seed is like marrubium [3-38]; the
root black, round, pale, shaped like a little apple, smelling 
earthy. It grows in rocky places. As much as a teaspoon of
a decoction of the seed (taken as a drink) is able to cause
nightmares. Applied with polenta it dissolves oedemas
and extracts thorns and splinters. The leaves are applied
to dissolve tubercles [growths] and boils or inflammatory
tumours. The root loosens the intestines and voids bile.
Two teaspoonfuls are given in honey and water. 
4-177. APIOS
SUGGESTED: Apios [Fuchs], Lathyrus arvensis repens tuberosus
[Bauhin], Lathyrus tuberosus [Linnaeus] 
— Earth Chestnut [Mabberley]
[other usage] Euphorbia apios — Pear-rooted Spurge
Apios sends out two or three small branches from the
earth — rushy, thin and red — lifting themselves a
little above the ground. The leaves are similar to rue [3-52, 
3-53, 4-98], green, yet somewhat longer and narrower.
The seed is small; the root similar to hastula [fistula?] regia
and in the shape of a pear, but rounder and full of juice,
with a black bark, and the inside white. This inner part of
the root is taken to draw out bile and phlegm by
vomiting, and the bark purges downward. Taken
together they induce purging both ways. If you are
prepared to juice it, beat the roots, throw them into a jar
of water, shake it together, take away the liquid standing
on top with a feather, and dry it. A decoction of fifteen
grains of this (taken as a drink) purges upward and
 730
BOOK FOUR: OTHER HERBS & ROOTS

downward. It is also called ischias, chamaebalanos, radix
montanus, radix sylvestris, or linozastis; the Romans call it
radix silvestris, and the Africans, thorphassadoe. 
4-178. KOLOKUNTHIS
SUGGESTED: Citrullus colocynthis, Cucumis colocynthis
— Colocynth, Bitter Apple, Bitter Gourd 
see 2-162
Colocynthis sends out small branches with jagged
leaves spread on the ground like those of the
cultivated cucumber, with a round fruit like a mid-sized
ball, strongly bitter, which you must gather when it
begins to change into a paler colour. The pulp of the fruit
is purging; forty grains is taken with honey water, or with 
saltpetre [potassium nitrate], or myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116],
boiled with honey and made into a catapotion [pill]. The
seeds themselves (dried and pounded into small pieces)
are effective mixed with enemas or suppositories for
sciatica, paralysis, and colic, for driving out phlegm and
bile, and for scouring out, sometimes even bloody stuff.
Used as a pessary they are abortifacient. This is a mouth
rinse for toothache, if you take the pith out of one, wrap it 
around with clay and boil it in vinegar and saltpetre
[potassium nitrate], then give it to wash the mouth with.
Boiled with honey water, or else passum [raisin wine],
cooled, and given to drink, it purges thick fluids and
scours the bowels. It is very bad for the stomach. A
suppository of it is inserted for voiding excrement. The
green juice of it is good, rubbed on sciatica.
It is also called  colocynthis capri, cucurbita amara, or
colocynthis Alexandrina ; Zoroastres calls it thymbra,
Osthenes calls it autogenes, the Romans, cucurbita sylvatica, 
and the Dacians, tutastra.
4-179. EPITHUMON
SUGGESTED: Cuscuta epithymum, Cuscuta minor 
— Clover Dodder, Lesser Dodder 
Epithymum has little heads, thin and light, with tails
like filaments. A decoction (taken as a drink with
honey) purges phlegm and black bile downwards. Four

    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

teaspoonfuls given with with honey and salt and a little
vinegar in an acetabulum [vinegar cruet] is suitable for the
depressive and those inflated with wind. It grows
abundantly in Cappadocia and Pamphyllia. It is also
called cedoes, and the Romans call it involucrum. It has a
flower like the harder thyme and like satureia. 
4-180. ALUPON
SUGGESTED: Globularia alypum — Globularia,
 Alypo Globe Daisy 
Alypum is a somewhat red shrubby herb, with thin
twigs and thin leaves; full of flowers, soft and light;
the root like beet, thin, full of sharp juice; the seed like
epithymum [above]. It grows in great abundance in
maritime places especially, in places in Libya, and
abundantly in other places also. The seed (taken with an
equal amount of salt, epithymum, and vinegar) purges
black bile downward, and it exits the intestines quickly.
4-181. EMPETRON
SUGGESTED: Empetrum nigrum — Crowberry, 
Black-berried Heath 
POISONOUS
Empetron grows in hilly maritime places, salty to the
taste, but that nearer to the earth is more bitter. Given 
in broth or honey water it purges phlegm, bile, and
watery matter. It is also called phacoides.
4-182. KLEMATITIS
SUGGESTED: Clematis flammula [Mabberley] — Clematis,
 Sweet Virgin's Bower 
Clematitis sends out somewhat reddish pliant
branches, and leaves especially sharp to the taste
and ulcerating. It winds around trees like smilax. A
decoction of the seed of this (pounded into small pieces
and taken as a drink with water or honey water) drives

phlegm and bile downwards. The leaves applied remove
leprosy. It is preserved in salt with lepidium [2-205] to be
eaten. 
4-183. AMPELOS AGRIA
SUGGESTED: Ampelos agria, Labrusca [Pliny], Vitis labrusca
— Wild Vine, Fox Grape
The wild vine sends out long sprigs like the vine,
woody and rough, with the bark chapped. The
leaves are like garden strychnos, but broader and longer.
The mossy flower has filaments; and the fruit is like little
grape clusters that ripen and grow red. The shape of the
seeds is round. The root of this (boiled in wine and taken
as a drink with two cups of seawater) purges out watery
matter. It is also given for dropsy. The clusters [of fruit]
clean away sunburn and every spot. The new shoots are
preserved in salt to eat with meat [vegetable]. 
4-184. AMPELOS LEUKE
SUGGESTED: Vitis-alba, Psilothrum, Bryonia [Fuchs],
 Brionia alba [Linnaeus], Bryonia dioica — White Bryony
Snake Bryony, White Wild Vine, Common Bryony
POISONOUS
Vitis alba  has branches, leaves and tendrils like the
cultivated vine, but all rougher. It is wrapped
around the shrubs standing nearby; catching hold with
its tendrils; and it has a red cluster-like fruit with which
hides are made bare of hair. The young tendrils of this are 
eaten (boiled) at the first placing-out, to move the urine
and bowels. The leaves, fruit, and root are sharp; as a
result they are effective applied with salt on those who
have had surgery, gangrene, and spreading, erosive,
rotten ulcers of the legs. The root cleans the skin and
smooths it [wrinkles], and with ervum [2-129, 2-131], terra
chia [earth from Chios], and fenugreek it takes off
sunburn, varicose veins, freckles, and black scars. Boiled
with oil until it is dissolved it is good for the same
purposes. It takes away bruises and represses whitlows
on the fingers. Pounded into small pieces and smeared
on with wine it dissolves inflammation, breaks abscesses,
 733
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

and extracts bones. It is mixed effectively with antiseptic
medicines. It is taken as a drink for epilepsy — one
teaspoon every day for a year. Taken in the same way it
helps those sick of apoplexy [rush of blood and dizziness] 
and vertigo. Two teaspoonfuls of a decoction (taken as a
drink) help those bitten by vipers, and are an
abortifacient. Sometimes it troubles the understanding
somewhat. A decoction (taken as a drink) induces urine,
and applied as a pessary to the womb it is an
abortifacient, and extracts the afterbirth. Syrup of it with
honey is given to those suffocated, to hard breathers and
coughers, to those with pain in the side, and for hernia
and convulsions. Thirty grains (as a decoction taken as a
drink with vinegar for thirty days) reduces the spleen,
and it is smeared on with figs for the same purposes. It is
boiled for a hip bath to clean the womb, and it is an
abortifacient. The root is juiced in the spring. This juice is
taken as a drink with honey and water for the same
purposes, as well as to expel phlegm. The fruit is good
(both rubbed on and applied) for parasitical skin diseases
and leprosy. The fruit is juiced and sipped up with boiled
wheat to draw out milk [breastfeeding]. It is also called
bryony, ophiostaphylon, chelidonion, melothron, psilothron,
archezostis, agrostis, or cedrostis.
4-185. AMPELOS MELAINA 
SUGGESTED: Vitis-nigra [Fuchs], Clematis sylvestris latifolia
[Bauhin],Clematis vitalba [Linnaeus], Viburnum gallorum, 
Vitis nigra — Wild Clematis, Traveller’s Joy, Biting Clematis,
Hedge Vine 
 POISONOUS
Vitis nigra has leaves and stalks like cissus [2-210] or
even more like those of smilax. These are bigger, and
this too takes hold of the trees with its tendrils. The fruit is 
clustered, green at first, but it grows black when ripe. The
root is black outside, but within the colour of box root.
The new stalks are eaten as vegetables. They are urinary,
expel the menstrual flow, and reduce the spleen. They
are good for epilepsy, vertigo and paralysis. The root has
the same properties as the white bryony, and is suitable
for the same uses yet it is less effective. The leaves
(smeared on with wine) are good for the necks of
 734
BOOK FOUR: OTHER HERBS & ROOTS

labouring beasts that are ulcerated, and they are applied
similarly for dislocations [ veterinary]. It is also called
black bryony, the chironian vine, or bucranium; the
Romans call it oblamenia, some, batanuta, or betisalca, the
Dacians, priadela, some, pegrina, and the Africans,
lauothen.

Male Polypody, Male Fern, Shield Fern
see 4-189
Pteris has leaves without stalks, flowers or seed out of
one stem, the height of about a foot, cut-in and
spread out wide like a wing, with a somewhat strong
smell. It has a root that lies shallow, black, somewhat
long, with many shoots, somewhat astringent to the
taste. It grows in rocky hilly places. Four teaspoonfuls of
the root of this is taken with honey and water to draw out 
broadworms. It works better if one gives it with forty
grains of scammony or black hellebore. It is necessary for
those who take it to eat garlic first. For the splenetic it is
given to restore them to their former state. A decoction of
the root (taken as a drink with goose grease and applied
as well) is good for those hurt with a fistula [ulcer]. The
proof is this: where there is much seed and much fern
enclosing it, there the fern vanishes. It is also called
blechnon, polyrrhizon, pterion, pterineon, dasyclonon, or
anasphoron; the Magi call it surculum Mercurii ; the
Romans, filix fanaria , some, laculla, or filix, and the
Egyptians call it the blood of an ass.

SUGGESTED: Thelypteris [Pliny], Felix,
Felix foemina [Fuchs], Pteris aquilina [Linnaeus], 
Pteridium aquilinum [in Sprague] — Buckler Fern, Brake Fern,
Bracken, Eagle Fern, Female Fern 
Thelypteris has leaves like those above, only not single-
stemmed, but with many higher abnormal growths.
The roots are underneath — long, thwarting, numerous,
yellowish-black, and some also red. These are taken with
honey as linctus [syrup] to expel broadworms. Three
teaspoons of a decoction (taken as a drink with wine)
expels roundworms. Given to women they cause
barrenness [birth control], and if any conceives she aborts 
[abortifacient]. Dried, they are applied to ulcers that are
moist and hard to cure, and they heal the necks of yoked
beasts. The newly put out leaves of it are used as
vegetables, and eaten boiled they soften the bowels. It is
also called nymphaea pteris, and the Romans call it lingua
cervina.
4-188. POLUPODION
SUGGESTED: Polypodium [Fuchs], Polypodium vulgare [Bauhin,
Linnaeus] — Common Polypody, Polypody Wall Fern, 
Golden Locks 
[other usage] Polypodium felix-faemina,
 Anthyrium felix-faemina, Aspidium felix-faemina — Lady Fern,
Female Polypody 
Polypodium grows on mossy rocks and on the wild
stocks of oaks; the height of twenty centimetres, like
fern, somewhat rough, cut-in, but not divided as thinly.
The hairy root lies underneath, with two curled locks like
a polypus, the thickness of a little finger; but scraped it is
green within, sharp, and with a somewhat sweet taste,
and it is purging. To purge it is given boiled together with 
a hen, fish, beets or mallows. Dried, powdered, and
sprinkled into honey and water, it expels phlegm and
bile; and the root (pounded into small pieces and
applied) is good for cleaning, and for cracks between the
fingers. It is also called scolopendrion, pteris, or polyrrhizon,
and the Romans call it filicula licitalis.

Polypodium dryopteris  —  Male Polypody, Male Fern,
 Shield Fern, Buckler Fern
see 4-186
Dryopteris grows on the mossy parts of old oaks like
fern, but there are fewer incisions. It has rough roots 
enfolded by plaiting — astringent to the taste, inclining to 
sweetness. This is applied (pounded into small pieces
with its roots) to make hair fall off. You must wipe away
the first application after it has moistened the skin, and
lay on fresh. It is also called pterion, or nymphaea pteris. 
4-190. KNIKOS
SUGGESTED: Cartamus, Crocus hortensis [Fuchs],
Carthamum officinarum, Cnicus sativus [Bauhin], 
Carthamus tinctorius [Linnaeus] — Safflower, Saffron Thistle
[Mabberley]
see 4-119
Cnicus has somewhat long leaves, cut-in, sharp and
prickly, and stalks a foot long on which are heads
the size of an olive; the flower like saffron [yellow
threads], the seed is white, reddish, somewhat long, and
angular. This flower they use for sauce with meats
[vegetable]. The seed is bruised and juiced with honey
water (or the broth of a hen) to purge the intestines. It is
bad for the stomach. Marzipan is made from it for
softening the intestines — the liquid of it mixed with
almonds, saltpetre [potassium nitrate], aniseed [3-65] and 
boiled honey. You must divide them in four parts about
the size of a carya [1-178] and take two or three of them
before supper. You must prepare it as follows: combine
one pint jar of white cnicus, three cups of almonds
(roasted and blanched), one pint of aniseed [3-65], a
teaspoon of the foam of saltpetre [potassium nitrate], and 
the flesh of thirty dried figs. The juice of the seed thickens 
milk and makes it more laxative.

4-191. LINOZOSTIS
SUGGESTED: Mercurialis mas [Fuchs], 
Mercurialis annua [Linnaeus] — Annual Mercury
lino — to smear; zoster — shingles
Linozostis has leaves like basil, similar to those of
helxine [4-39, 4-86] but smaller, and little branches
with two joints and many thick wings. The seed of the
female grows in abundant clusters. The male has
branches that are small and round, as though it were, two 
little stones lying together. The whole shrub is twenty
centimetres long or more, and both types (used as
vegetables and eaten) induce movement of the bowels.
Boiled in water (and the water taken as a drink) they
expel bile and watery stuff. It is thought that the leaves of
the female (pounded into small pieces and taken as a
drink, as well as applied to the genitals after the
menstrual flow cleansing) causes the conception of a
female child, and that if the leaves of the male are used in
the same way, it comes to pass that a male child is born. It
is also called argyros, aritrillis, or chrysitis; the Egyptians
call it aphlopho, the Romans, herba Mercurialis mascula, or
testiculata, the Africans, asumes; and it is also called
parthenium, or herbula Mercurii. 
4-192. KUNOKRAMBE
SUGGESTED: Cynocrambe, Mercurialis sylvestris mas, Cynocrambe 
mas [Fuchs], Mercurialis perennis [Linnaeus]

Cynia (or cynocrambe) sends out small tender stems
two feet high, somewhat white, with whitish leaves
at distances, like mercuria annua [4-191] or cissus. The seed
lying by the leaves is little and round. Both the stalk and
the leaves (taken as a decoction or as vegetables) are able
to move the bowels. The water from their boiling expels
bile and watery stuff. It is also called the wild male
linozostis; the Africans call it harmas, and some,
asumeslabon.

4-193. ELIOTROPION MEGA
SUGGESTED: Heliotropium europaeum — Heliotrope, Turnsole,
Cherry Pie 
The great heliotropium is named from the leaves
turning around towards the setting of the sun. It has
leaves like basil but rougher, darker, and bigger; and (as it 
were) three or four or five shoots from the root, and on
these many wings. On the tops are white flowers
inclining to a purple, winding around like the tail of a
scorpion. The root is thin and of no use. Boiled with water 
and taken as a drink as much as a handful of this expels
phlegm and bile through the bowels. A decoction (taken
as a drink with wine and also smeared on) is good for
those touched by scorpions. It is hanged around one to
cause barrenness. And they say that a decoction of four
grains of the seed (taken as a drink with wine one hour
before the time of the fit) cures quartains; and three,
tertians [ recurrent paroxysmic fevers]. The seed is
smeared on to dry up protruding warts, hanging warts,
warty abnormal growths, and pustules appearing at
night. The leaves are usefully smeared on for gout,
dislocations, and children that have siriasis [sunstroke];
pounded into small pieces and applied, they induce the
movement of the menstrual flow, and are abortifacient.
From the form of the flowers some have called it
scorpiuron, heliotropos, dialion, heliopun, scorpioctonon,
sesamon sylvestre, or scorpij cauda. 
4-194. ELIOTROPION MIKRON
SUGGESTED: Heliotropium amplexicaule — Blue Heliotrope
 Heliotropium ciliatum — White Heliotrope
The little heliotropium grows in marshy places and near 
lakes, with leaves like that mentioned above, only
rounder; with round seed hanging like hanging warts. A
decoction of the herb and seed (taken as a drink with
saltpetre [potassium nitrate], hyssop [3-30], nasturtium
[2-185], and water) is able to drive out broadworms and
roundworms. Smeared on with salt it takes away
hanging warts.

BOOK FIVE: VINES & WINES
We have given an account, most loving Areius, in
the four books written before, of spices, oils,
ointments, and of trees and their fruits and gums; and
furthermore of living creatures, of honey, milk and fats,
and of those called corn and vegetables, and a full
discussion about roots, herbs, juices and seeds. In this,
the last of the whole work, we will discuss wines and
metallic things, beginning with the tract concerning the
vine. 
5-1. AMPELOS OINOPHOROS
SUGGESTED: Vitis vinifera — Grape Vine
The leaves and tendrils of the wine-bearing vine
(pounded into small pieces and applied with
polenta) lessen headaches, and the inflammation and
burning of the stomach. The leaves do the same (applied
by themselves) as they are cooling and astringent.
Furthermore, the juice of them (taken as a drink) helps
dysentery, bloodspitters, gastritis, and women that lust
[anaphrodisiac]. The tendrils (steeped in water and taken 
as a drink) do the same things. The resin from it is like
gum thickening around the stumps, and taken as a drink
with wine it draws out stones [urinary, kidney] [calculi].
Rubbed on, it heals lichen [ papular skin disease],
parasitical skin diseases, and leprosy but you must first
rub the place with saltpetre [potassium nitrate]. The
liquid that sweats out from a burning green branch
(smeared on with oil) removes hair, and rubbed on it
takes off warts. The ashes of the branches, husks and
seeds after the grapes are pressed (smeared on with
vinegar and applied around the perineum), heal venereal 
warts and glandular fever. Applied with rosaceum [1-53],
rue [3-52, 3-53, 4-98] and vinegar it is good for
dislocations, viper bites, and inflammation of the spleen.

5-2. AMPELOS AGRIA
SUGGESTED: Ampelodesma tenax — Vine-tie, Diss
 Vitis labrusca  — Wild Vine or Fox Grape
Two types of wild vine are found. The grape of one
sort does not ripen, but at its flowering time it brings
forth shoots or buds. The other brings to ripeness a grape
that is small-grained, black and astringent. The leaves,
tendrils and stalks have properties similar to the
cultivated vine. 
5-3. STAPHULE
SUGGESTED: Vitis vinifera — Raisins — Grapes  — Grape Vine
Every grape which is newly gathered disturbs the
intestines and puffs up the stomach, but those which
have hanged for some time share only a little of these
qualities because much of the liquid has dried up. It is
good for the stomach, restores the appetite, and is fit for
those who are weak. Taken out of their own rubbish
[Pliny mentions grapes stored in pressed-out grape skins, 
often with wine] out of ceramic pots, they are pleasing to
the mouth, good for the stomach, and astringent to the
intestines. They hurt the bladder and head, but they are
good for bloodspitters. Those put into must [pulp from
grapes] are similar. Those from sapa [syruped new wine]
or passum [raisin wine] are worse for the stomach. They
are also kept in rainwater, having first been dried in the
sun. These are a little pleasantly like wine, yet are
effective for thirst, those in a burning heat, and
long-lasting fevers. The dregs from them is stored and
applied with salt for inflammation, hard lumps, and
swelling of the breasts. A decoction of these discards
(given as a suppository) helps dysentery, the abdominal
cavity, and womens flows [ menstrual flows]. It is taken
for hip bathing and warm packs. The seeds from them are 
astringent and good for the stomach. Dried, pounded
into small pieces, and sprinkled on instead of polenta,
they are good for dysentery, and the abdominal cavity,
and those who have a queasy stomach.

5-4. STAPHIS
SUGGESTED: Vitis vinifera — Dried Grapes and Raisins 
— Grape Vine 
The white uva passae  are astringent and their flesh
(eaten) is good for the throat, coughs, kidneys and
bladder, as well as for dysentery (either eaten alone with
the seeds or mixed with meal of millet, meal of barley and 
an egg, then fried with honey and taken). It is good either 
by itself or chewed with pepper to draw phlegm out of
the head. Applied with meal of beans and cumin it
soothes inflammation from stones [ urinary, kidney].
Pounded into small pieces without the seeds and applied
with rue [3-52, 3-53, 4-98] it heals epinyctis [pustule which
appears only at night], carbuncles [infected boils]
[malignant skin tumours], favus [ contagious skin
disease], rotten ulcers around the joints and gangrenes. It 
is good applied with the juice of panax [opopanax 3-55] for
gout. Applied to loose nails it soon draws them off.
5-5. OINANTHE
SUGGESTED: Ampelodesma tenax — Vine-tie, Diss
 Vitis labrusca —Grapes from the Wild Vine 
Oenanthe is Water Dropwort or Water Hemlock — poisonous
The fruit of the wild vine when it flowers is called
oenanthe. After they have first gathered it and dried it
on a sheet in the shade it must be put into a ceramic jar.
The best is from Syria, Cilicia and Phoenicia. It is
astringent; as a result a decoction (taken as a drink) is
good for the stomach and urine, for stopping the
intestines, and the spitting of blood. Dried and smeared
on, it is effective for a queazy sour stomach. It is used both 
green and dry (with vinegar and rosaceum [1-53]) as an
inhalant for headaches. Pounded into small pieces with
honey, saffron, rosaceum [1-53] and myrrh [1-77, 1-73,
4-116], it is a poultice for bleeding wounds (keeping them
from inflaming), as well as new ulcers in the eye and in
the mouth, and gangrenous ulceration on the genitals. It
is mixed with suppositories for repressing blood. For
discharges of the eyes and a burning stomach it is
smeared on with flour of polenta and wine. Burnt in a
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK
 745

ceramic jar with kindled coals it is good to add to eye
medicines. With honey it heals hangnails, pterygium
[membrane on eye], and broken bleeding gums. 
5-6. OMPHACION 
 Vitis vinifera — Juice from Unripe Grapes — Grape Vine 
Omphacium is the juice from unripe Thasian or
Aminaean grapes. Having pressed out the juice
before the hottest days come, you must keep it in a red
brass jar in the sun (covered with a linen cloth) until it has 
thickened, always mixing that which congeals with the
moist. Towards night take it in from the open air as the
dews hinder the thickening. Choose that which is yellow, 
brittle, very astringent and biting to the tongue. Some
boil the juice to thicken it. It is good with honey or passum
[raisin wine] for the tonsils, the uvula, for mouth ulcers,
moist flabby gums, and purulent ears; but with vinegar
for fistulas, old ulcers, and gangrenous ulceration of the
cheeks. It is given as a suppository for dysentery and
women’s menstrual flows. It is also a sight-restorer. It is
good for the roughness and disorders of the corners of
the eyes. It is taken as a drink for recent bloodspitting and 
for bleeding from a rupture. You must use it diluted very
well and only a little of it too, for it burns excessively.

WINES
5-7. Old Wines
Old wines hurt the nerves and the rest of the senses,
yet they are pleasant to the taste. Therefore they are 
to be avoided by those who have any part weak within.
For the use of it in health a little is taken without hurt, and 
that diluted in water. New wine is inflative, hard to
digest, a cause of nightmares, and is urinary. That of a
middle age avoids either of these evils, as a result it is to
be chosen for the uses of both health and sickness. 
5-8. The Colour of Wine 
Further, white wine is thin, easily digested and good
for the stomach. The dark wine is thick and hard to
digest, heady and fattening. The claret has a middle
colour and also a middle strength compared to either of
these, yet the white should be chosen both in health and
sickness. Furthermore they differ in respect of their
qualities.
5-9. The Flavours of Wines and their
Properties
For the sweet wine consists of thick particles and is
hard to evaporate, puffing up the stomach very much 
and disturbing the intestines and the bowels like must
[grape pulp], yet it inebriates less and is helpful for the
bladder and kidneys. Sharp wine is more urinary and
causes both headaches and drunkenness. Unripe wine is
most suitable for digesting meats, and it stops the
intestines and other discharges. That which is mild
affects the sinewy parts less and it is less urinary. That
made with seawater is bad for the stomach, causing thirst
and hurting the strength; however it is good for the
bowels, but unsuitable for those lately recovered from
sickness. Passum [raisin wine] made from sun-dried
grapes or those dried on the branches and pressed is
called creticum, protropum, or pramnium, and that of boiled 
must [grape pulp] is called sirion, or hepsema. That which
 747
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

is black (called melampsithion) is thick and very
nourishing. The white is thinner and that in the middle
has a middle strength. All are binding like pulses
[leguminous seeds], and good against all poisons
[antidote] which kill by ulcerating (taken as a drink with
oil and vomited up again); also against meconium [4-65],
pharmicum [? poison], toxicum [?dogbane], hemlock and
milk curdled in the stomach, as well as against disorders
of the bladder, and kidneys that are corroded and
ulcerated. They are windy and bad for the stomach.
Melampsithium is suitable for those who have flowing
bowels. The white is more softening for the intestines
than the other. That which contains gypsum is offensive
to the strength, causes the pains in the head, and is
burning and worthless for the bladder. It is better than
the other against poisons. Wines that contain pitch (or
rosin from pine) are warming and digestive, yet hurtful
for bloodspitters. Those called aparachyta have sapa
[syruped new wine] mixed with them, and fill the head
causing drunkenness. They are difficult to evaporate and
worthless for the stomach.
5-10. Wines from Different Countries
Of the wines of Italy (in which it seems to excel) one is 
called falernum, which is old and easily digested,
binding the intestines like pulses, good for the stomach
but bad for the bladder, and unsuitable for the dull-
sighted or for much to be taken as a drink. The Albanian
has thicker particles than the falernian and is sweetish,
puffing up the stomach and soothing the intestines, not
as good for the digestion, and hurting the strength less.
When this is old it grows hard. The caecubum is sweet,
with thicker particles than the Albanian, fattening and
with a good colour, but bad for the digestion. The
surrentinum is very hard; as a result it stops excessive
discharges of the intestines and of the stomach, and it
affects the head less because it has light particles, but
when old it is good for the stomach and becomes more
pleasant. The adrianum and the mamertianum grow in
Sicily. Both have thick particles, are mildly astringent,
grow old quickly, and affect the strength less because of
their mildness. Praepianum (which is brought out of the
places around Adria) has a sweet scent and is milder, but
 748
WINES

if too much is taken as a drink it does not hide, but keeps
the drunkenness for a long time and brings sleep. Istricum
is like praepianum only more urinary. The chium is more
gentle than those previously mentioned — nourishing,
drinkable, making one less drunk, stopping excessive
discharges, and effective to add to eye medicines. The
Lesbian wine [from Lesbos] is easily digested, lighter than
the Chian wine [from Scios in the Aegean sea] and good
for the intestines. That which grows in Ephesus (called
phygelites) has the same properties as this, but that from
Asia (called messogites), from the mountain Tmolus,
causes headaches and hurts the strength. The coon and
clazomenian (because they have so much seawater) are
soon spoiled, inflative, disturb the intestines, and hurt
the strength. 
5-11. The Effects of Wines
Generally, all unmixed and simple wine (hard by
nature) is warming, easily digested and good for the 
stomach. It encourages the appetite, is nourishing,
induces sleep, and causes a good colour. Taken liberally
as a drink it helps [ antidote] those who have taken
hemlock, coriander, pharmicum [? poison], ixia [3-103],
meconium [4-65], lithargyrum [5-102], smilax, aconitum
[4-77, 4-78] or mushrooms; as well as for snakebites and
the strikes of all that by striking or biting kill by cold or
overturn the stomach. It is effective for long-lasting
windiness, anxiety from hypochondrium [nervous gastric
disorder], distension and hiccups of the stomach, and
excessive discharges of the bowels and intestines. It is
good for sweating and those who faint from it, especially
the white, old, sweet-smelling wines. The old sweet
wines (applied with lana succida [underneath wool]) are
more useful for disorders of the bladder and kidneys, as
well as for wounds and inflammation. They are usefully
applied with hot cloths for malignancies and eating,
running ulcers. Those without seawater (hard and white) 
are fitting for use in times of health. Of these the Italian
wines excel, such as falernum, surrentinum, caecubum,
signenan, many others from Campania, the praepian from
the Adriatic coast, and the Sicilian called mamertinum. Of
the Greek wines, there is the Chian [from Scios in the
Aegean sea], the Lesbian wine [from Lesbos], and the
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK
 749

phygelites from Ephesus. Thick black wines are bad for the 
stomach and inflative yet increase body weight. Those
thinner and harder are good for the stomach and increase 
body weight less. Those that are very old and thin and
white are more urinary, yet if taken as a drink too much
they affect the strength. Wines of a middle age are best
for drinking, such as those of seven years. The amount
consumed must be gauged by the person's age, the time
of the year, the customs of the drinker, and the quality of
the wine. The best rule is not to be thirsty and to indulge
moderately, for all drunkenness (especially that which is
continual) is pernicious. For the strength, besieged daily
(at last) yields, and too much drinking every day allows
the entrance of sharp disorders. Taken moderately as a
drink for a few days (especially after drinking water) it is
acceptable. It alters the state of a man in a way, purging
vapors that annoy the senses, and opening the internal
organs secretly. Yet after drinking wine you must drink
water, for it brings some help in avoiding illness owing to
drunkenness.
5-12. OMPHAKITES OINOS
SUGGESTED: Lesbian Wine [from Lesbos]
The wine called omphacites is made properly in Lesbos.
The grapes (not yet ripe in every part but tasting
sour) are dried in the sun for three or four days until the
clusters are wrinkled, and after pressing out the wine is
placed in the sun in ceramic jars. It is astringent, good for
the stomach, for lustful women [ anaphrodisiac], those
with pains in the small intestine, those with difficult
digestion, and a squeamish stomach. It is sipped up to
help plague symptoms. Such wines as these are used
after many years, for otherwise they are not drinkable.
5-13. DEUTERIAS OINOS
SUGGESTED: Deuteria or Secondary Wine
Deuteria which some call potimon is made as follows:
into the husks of the grapes out of which you have
pressed two hundred and seventy gallons of wine, put in
thirty nine gallons of water. Mix it, trample it, strain it out, 
 750
WINES

and boil it down to two thirds. To every four and a half
litres of the liquid that is left add two pints of salt, and
after winter pour it out into ceramic jars, but [do not] use
it after a year, as it grows weak quickly. It is fit for those to
whom we are unsure about giving wine and yet feel
compelled to satisfy the desire of the sick, and for those
who have recovered from a sickness that lasted long. A
wine is made called adynamon [lack of vital powers], with
the same strength as deuteria. Mix an equal measure of
water and must [grape pulp], boil it gently over a soft fire
until the water is used up, and after cooling it pour it out
into a pitch glazed jar. Some mix an equal amount of sea
water, rain water, honey and must, pour it out into
another jar and set it in the sun for forty days. They use it
for a year for the same purposes. 
5-14. Wine of Wild Grapes 
SUGGESTED: Cissus digitata — Wild Grape, Sorrel Vine
 Vitis labrusca — Wild Grapes
The black wine from the wild grape is astringent. It is
good for flowing intestines and the stomach and
many other things that require astringency and
contraction. 
5-15. OINOS MELETITES
SUGGESTED: Old Wine with Honey
Vinum melitites is given in long-lasting fevers to those
who have a weak stomach because it gently loosens
the bowels, induces urine, and purges the stomach. It is
good for arthritis, kidney disease, and those who have a
weak head. It is useful for women to drink with water as
it has a fragrant smell and is nourishing. It differs from
mead [honey wine] because that is made from hard old
wine and a little honey, but for meletites five gallons of
hard wine is added to four and a half litres of honey and
one winecup of salt. You must make it in a large jar so that 
it may have room to ferment lustily, sprinkling on the salt 
little by little until it is quite fermented, and when it stops, 
pour it out into other ceramic jars. 
 751
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

5-16. OINOMELI
SUGGESTED: Mulsum — Honeyed Wine, Mead
Mulsum is preferred which is made from old hard
wine and good honey. Such as this creates less gas
and is quickly fit to be used. Old mulsum is nutritive and
the middle-aged is good for the bowels and diuretic.
Taken after meat it hurts; taken as a drink beforehand it
fills, but after that it encourages the appetite. It is usually
made with nine gallons of honey mixed with eighteen
gallons of wine. So that they may make it fit for use
quickly, some boil the honey together with the wine and
pour it into jars. For the sake of profit, some mix six pints
of boiling must to one pint jar of honey, and after it has
done boiling, pour it into other jars. It remains sweet.
5-17. MELIKRATON
SUGGESTED: Melicrate — Water Mead, Honey Water
Melicrate has the same strength as mead [honey
wine]. We use it (boiled) for those in whom we
wish to soften the bowels or cause vomiting, as well as for
those that have taken a drink of poison [vomitory], giving 
it with oil. We use it (boiled) for those who have feeble
pulses, the weak, coughers, pneumonia, and those who
faint with sweating. That which is provided and put in
jars for storage that they properly call hydromel [honey
water] is of a middle age and similar to the second-
pressed wine and adynamon [for the lack of vital powers]
as it also restores the strength. As a result it is more
suitable than second-pressed wine for those who have
inflammation in some part. That which is older is not
allowed for those who have inflammation and are
constipated. It is suitable for those with a sore stomach,
no appetite, or those who faint with sweating. It is made
from two parts of old rainwater mixed with one of honey
and placed in the sun. Others use fountain water, boil it
down to one third and put it in jars. Honey water is also
made from the honeycombs washed out with water and
put in jars.  When it is necessary to make it like this some
also boil it. It is unsuitable for the sick because it has too
much waxy stuff. 
 752
WINES

5-18. UDOR
SUGGESTED: Water
Water in general is difficult to analyse because of the
individualities of places and their peculiar natures 
and the air and many other things. For the most part the
best is pure and sincerely sweet, not having any other
quality whatsoever, or staying in the digestive system
very long, furthermore soon passing through without
trouble, and not inflative nor spoiled.
5-19. UDOR THALASSION
SUGGESTED: Seawater
Water from the sea is hot, sharp, and bad for the
stomach. It troubles the bowels, expelling phlegm. 
Applied with hot cloths when it is warm it extracts and
dissolves. It is good for disorders of the nerves, and
chilblains before ulceration. It is conveniently mixed with 
poultices of barley meal, and it is suitable for plasters and
solutions for warm compresses. It is given lukewarm as a
suppository for evacuations, and warm for griping. It is a
wash for parasitic skin diseases, itches, lichen [skin disease 
with red pustules], nits, and breasts swollen with milk.
Applied with hot cloths it dissolves all bruises, and is
good for bites from poisonous creatures that cause
trembling and quaking chills — especially from
scorpions, harvest spiders and snakes. Moreover, it is
good if anyone goes into a hot bath of it; such a bath is
helpful for long-lasting disorders of the body and the
strength. Inhaled as steam it eases dropsy, headaches,
and hardness of hearing. Seawater put in jars alone and
not mixed with drinkable water becomes unpoisonous,
but some boil it beforehand and then put it in jars. It is
given as a purge by itself (or with posca [hot drinks], wine
or honey), and after the purging they give the broth of a
hen or fish to alleviate the sharpness of the pangs of
hunger. 
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK
 753

5-20. THALASSOMELI
SUGGESTED: Seawater Sweetened with Honey
Thalassomeli is thought to purge very well. It is made
from the same amount each of honey, rainwater and
seawater, strained, and placed in the sun in a pitch-
glazed jar in the burning heat of the hottest days. Some
mix two parts of boiled seawater and one of honey and
store it in a jar. This is more moderate and milder than
seawater alone. 
5-21. OXUS
SUGGESTED: Acetum — Vinegar
Acetum cools and is astringent. It is good for the
stomach and to encourage an appetite. It staunches
excessive bloody discharges, either taken as a drink or sat
in as a bath. It is good boiled together with meat for
discharges of the bowels. It is fit for bleeding wounds,
and applied with unwashed wool or sponges keeps
inflammation away. It represses the vulva and perineum
that have fallen down, and broken bleeding gums. It is
also good for gangrenous ulceration, erysipela
[streptococcal skin infection], shingles [herpes], psoriasis,
lichen [ skin disease with red pustules], and pterygium
[membrane on eye] mixed with some other medicine
from those that are suitable. Continuously applied with
hot cloths it stops eating ulcers and gangrenous
ulceration of the cheeks. Applied with hot cloths and
sulphur it helps gout, and rubbed on it takes away
bruises. With rosaceum [1-53] and unwashed wool (or a
sponge) it is good for burning fevers of the head. Inhaled
as a steam it helps those with difficult hearing, or noises
and hissings of the ears. Dropped in the ears it kills
worms. It represses favus [contagious honeycombed skin
disease] applied lukewarm with hot cloths or sponges. It
soothes itching. For the bites of venomous creatures that
chill, a warm pack of it is good; but a cold one for those
that spit poison that burns. It is good against all poisons
[vomitory] taken warm as a drink and spewed up again,
especially against the drinking of meconium [4-65] or
hemlock. It is given against bloodclotting, or milk
 754
WINES

curdling in the stomach, and with salt against
mushrooms, ixia [3-103] and smilax. Sipped up, it expels
leeches that were taken in a drink. It soothes an old cough 
but aggravates a new one. It is good sipped up warm for
asthma. Gargled, it restrains discharges in the throat. It is
good for a synanchic [abscessed] throat, for the middle
ear that has fallen, and is rolled around the teeth (warm)
for toothache. 
5-22. OXUMELI
SUGGESTED: Oxymel, Vinegar Honey
Oxymel is made as follows. Take five half pints of
vinegar, two pounds of sea salt, twenty pounds of
honey and five pints of water, mix it all, boil it until it boils 
ten times, cool it, and pour it into another jar. It is thought 
that (taken) it expels thick fluids, and helps sciatica,
arthritis and epilepsy. It is available for those bitten by the 
viper seps [poisonous lizard], and for those who have
taken a drink of meconium [4-65] or ixia [3-103] [antidote].
It is a helpful gargle for synanchia [abscessed throat].
5-23. OXALME
SUGGESTED: Vinegar and Salt
Acetum salsum  (applied with hot cloths) is good for
gangrenous ulcers, rotten ulcers, dog bites and bites
from venomous creatures. It stops discharges of blood
from those who are castrated, poured warm into the
wound straight after the surgeon has done. It helps a
perineum that is fallen down, and it is given as a
suppository for dysentery with gangrenous ulceration,
but afterwards you must give an enema with milk.
Sipped up and gargled it kills leeches, and cleans
dandruff and running ulcers on the head.

5-24. THUMOXALME
SUGGESTED: Thymoxalme — Thyme Vinegar 
 Thymus vulgaris — Common Thyme 
The ancients used thymoxalme for those with a weak
stomach (mixing three or four cups with warm
water) as well as for arthritis and those inflated with
wind. It extracts thick black fluids, and it is made as
follows. Take an acetabulum [vinegar cruet] of thyme
pounded into small pieces, an equal amount of salt, and a
little each of polenta, rue [3-52, 3-53, 4-98] and pulegium
[3-36]; throw them into a jar, pour on them three pints of
water and a quarter pint of vinegar, wrap it in a linen
cloth, and set it in the open air.
5-25. SKILLETIKON OXUS
SUGGESTED: Scilla maritima, Ornithogalum maritima,
 Urginea scilla, Urginea maritima  — Medicinal Squill,
 Sea Onion, Squill — Squill Vinegar 
POISONOUS
Scillinum vinegar is made as follows. Clean the white
squill and cut it in slices, then pierce them through
with a thread so that the slices do not touch one another,
and dry them in the shade for forty days. Then take one
pound of it, put it into twelve pints of good vinegar, and
leave it in the sun to steep for forty days, corking the jar
carefully. After this remove the squill, press it out, and
put it away. Strain the vinegar, pour it into a jar and
preserve it. Some mix a pound of dried squill to five pints
of vinegar. Some, immediately it is clean without being
dried, put in an equal measure of vinegar and let it steep
for six months. This is sharper. It is astringent and
strengthening, good as a mouth rinse for loose, swelling
gums, and for loose teeth, effectively curing rotten ulcers
around the mouth and stinking breath. Sipped up, it
strengthens the jaws and makes them hard, and it makes
the voice loud and clear. Those with difficult digestion,
epilepsy, vertigo, and depression take it. They also take it
for gastritis and delirium, as well as for womb
constriction, swollen spleen, and sciatica. It restores those 
who are extremely weak. It makes the body sound with a
 756
WINES

good colour. It is a sight-restorer and it is effective
dropped in the ears for the hard of hearing. In general it is 
good for all things except internal ulcers, headaches and
disorders of the nerves. A little of it is given to those
fasting (when they are beginning) to sip day by day, and
a while after increase it to a winecupful but to some give
two cups or more. 
5-26. OINOS SKILLETIKOS
SUGGESTED: Scilla maritima, Ornithogalum maritima, 
Urginea scilla, Urginea maritima — Medicinal Squill, 
Sea Onion, Squill — Squill Wine 
POISONOUS
Squill wine is made as follows. Cut apart the squill, as I
have said [above], and dry it in the sun. Then cut one
pound of it, and having sarced [scraped, chopped] it with 
a thin sarce [blade], wrap it in a thin linen cloth, put it into 
twenty pints of good new must [grape pulp] and let it
steep for three months. After this pour out the wine into
other jars, sealed carefully. One may also use the moist
squill, cutting it in the shape of a navew [naphew, swede]
and doubling the amount; but you must keep it in the sun 
forty days and let it be very old [before using it]. 
Squill wine is also made this way. Take three pounds
of the cleaned, cut-apart squill, put into it an Italian nine
gallons [six gallons and seven pints] of good must, and
having corked it, leave it alone six months. Then strain it
and put it in another jar and put it away. It is good for
indigestion from spoiled meat, for those who vomit it up,
and for those who have thick fluids in their bowels or
stomach, as well as for the spleen, those who have
cachexis [ malnutrition], dropsy, jaundice, frequent
painful urination, or griping; also those distressed with
gaseousness, paralysis, long-lasting chills, vertigo, or
convulsions. It expels the menstrual flow, and does not
annoy the tendons at all. The older it is, the better. You

internal ulcer.

5-27. OINOS THALASSIKOS
SUGGESTED: Wine made with Seawater
Wines are made with seawater in various ways.
Some add seawater after the grapes are gathered;
others first place them in the sun and tread them, mixing
in seawater; others make raisins from the grapes and
steep them with seawater in casks. This wine becomes
sweet. Those that are made with a harder taste are good
against the signs of approaching acute fevers (if there is
nothing better at hand), for bringing down the intestines, 
and for rotten spitters, hard bowels, and anyone affected
in the head by Aminaean wines. Yet these are bad for the
stomach and cause wind.

So that this history may be complete for those who
love histories, we think it is not out of place to
describe the making of many other sorts of wine, not
because they are useful or suitable, but so that we may
not omit anything. There are some of them that require
less skill to make yet they have use, such as wines of
quinces, pears and pods [carob tree — Ceratonia siliqua]
and that which is made from myrtle berries.
5-28. OINOS KUDONITES
SUGGESTED: Cotonea malus, Cydonia [Fuchs], 
Mala cotonea minora [Bauhin], Pyrus cydonia [Linnaeus],

Cydonites wine is made as follows. Remove the seeds
from the quinces, cut them up like a navew [naphew,
swede] and put twelve pounds of them into nine gallons
of must [grape pulp] for thirty days. Afterwards strain it
and put it in jars. It is also made as follows: after beating
and pressing out the quinces, mix them with twelve pints
of quince juice and one pint jar of honey and put it in jars. 
It is astringent, good for the stomach, and suitable for
dysentery, liver ailments, kidney disorders, and frequent
painful urination. It is also called melites.
5-29. MELOMELI
SUGGESTED: Cotonea malus, Cydonia [Fuchs], 
Mala cotonea minora [Bauhin], Pyrus cydonia [Linnaeus],
Cydonia oblonga, Cydonia vulgaris — Quince

seeds removed) are put into a good amount of
honey, so that they are covered. This becomes pleasant
after a year like mead [honey wine]. It has the same uses
as the confection above. It is also called cydonomeli.

The properties of this are also the same [as the above]. 
5-31. OMPHACOMELITIS
SUGGESTED: Vitis vinifera — Grape Vine — Grapes & Honey
Omphacomelitis is made this way. Take unripe grapes
not yet changing colour, place them in the sun for
three days, and after having pressed them add to three
parts of the juice one part of the best purified measurable
honey, and keep it in the sun, having poured it into jars.
It is repressive and cooling, and it is good for gastritis and
the abdominal cavity. It can be used after [?for] a year. 
5-32. OINOS APITES
SUGGESTED: Pyrus communis — Pear Wine
Pear wine is made the same way as that of quinces but
do not let the pears stand until they are overripe.

the same way. They are all astringent, sourish, good for
the stomach, and restrain discharges from within. 
5-33. OINOS OINANTHINOS
SUGGESTED: Ampelodesma tenax —  Vine-tie, Diss
 Vitis labrusca — Wild Vine

stomach, lack of appetite, for the abdominal cavity, and
for dysentery. 
5-34. OINOS ROITES
SUGGESTED: Roites — Rhoa — Punica granatum
— Pomegranate Wine 
Pomegranate wine is made as follows. Take ripe
Apyrenian pomegranates, and having pressed the
juice out of the grains put it in jars; or, having boiled it to
two thirds, put it in jars. It is good for discharges from
within, for fevers accompanied with excessive discharges 
of the bowels, and for the stomach, as well as for binding
the bowels, and it is urinary. 
5-35. OINOS RODITES
SUGGESTED: Rosa canina, Rosa rugosa — Rodites — Rose Wine
Redites is made as follows. Bind one pound of roses —
that were dried and pounded — in a linen cloth and
put it into eight pints of must [grape pulp]. After three
months strain it, put it in other jars and put it away. It is
good for those without fever, for digestion of the stomach 
and its disorders (taken as a drink after meat), as well as
for moist bowels and dysentery. It is also made with the
juice of roses and honey mixed together and this is called
rhodomeli. It is good for roughness in the throat.
5-36. OINOS MURTITES
SUGGESTED: Myrtites — Myrtus communis — Myrtle Wine
Myrteum is made as follows. Take black overripe
myrtle berries, beat them, squeeze out the juice
with a press and put it in a jar. Some also boil it away to
two thirds; and some set the berries out in the sun first,
then dry them and mix three half pints of water and an
equal amount of old wine to two pints of them, pounded,
and then they strain it out and put it in jars. It is
excessively astringent, good for the stomach, and 
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK
 761

effective for a flowing stomach and intestines, also for
ulcers within, and excessive discharges, and it makes the
hair on the head black [dye].
5-37. OINOS MURSINITES
SUGGESTED: Myrtus communis var romana 
— Broad-leaved Myrtle 
Myrsinites is made as follows. Take the branches and
leaves of the black myrtle with the myrtle berries,
beat them, put ten pounds of this pounded myrtle into
three gallons of must and boil it until two thirds remain,
or half. Then strain it and put it in jars. This is good for
running ulcers on the head, dandruff, and contagious
rashes; as well as for gums, the tonsils, and pus-filled
ears, and it also stops sweats.
5-38. OINOS SCHININOS
SUGGESTED: Schinus [Bedevian] — Mastic Tree, Pepper Tree
 Schinus molle, Pistacia lentiscus, Bursera gummifera, 
 Sideroxylon mastichodendron — Herb Mastic 
Schinus molle is now an American genus; Bursera gummifera is now a West Indian tree 
[Loudon].
Schininus wine is made the same way as myrtle wine
[above].
5-39. OINOS TERMINTHINOS
SUGGESTED: Terminthinus — Pistacia terebinthus 
— [Old English] Termenteyne — Turpentine Tree 
Termininthos is made the same way as myrtle wine
[above]. The branches of these are taken when they
have fruit, and they have the same strength as myrtle
wine [above] — astringent, good for the stomach, and
suitable to use for discharges of the stomach, intestines,
and bladder, and for bloody discharges. Applied with hot 
cloths they form a skin over running ulcers, and they
repress discharges around the womb and perineum
when sat in [a hip bath].

OTHER WINES

5-40. OINOS PHOINIKITES
SUGGESTED: Phoenix dactylifera — Date Palm Wine
Palmeum. Take common ripe dates and put them into a 
small cask bored through in the bottom and corked
with a pitch-covered reed. Let the hole be covered with
linen. To twenty pints of dates put in three gallons of
water. If you would not have it too sweet pour in five
gallons, and let it rest for ten days. On the eleventh day,
take the linen cloth away from the reed, let out the thick
sweet wine, and put it in jars. It is exceptionally sweet
and worthless for the head, but good for discharges
because it is astringent. It is fit for gastritis, the abdominal
cavity and for bloodspitters. Some mix it with water, and
they do this a third, fourth, and fifth time when that
which is left grows sour. 
5-41. OINOS KATORCHITES
SUGGESTED: Catorchites — Ficus carica — Wine made with Figs
Catorchites is made in Cyprus like the palmeum wine. It
differs because instead of water, some put in an
infusion of equal amounts of newly-pressed husks and
stones of grapes. Dry, black, Chelidonian or Phoenician
figs are added and steeped as in date wine [above]. After
ten days the liquid is taken out and the same measure of
the infusion of the husks and stones is poured on a
second and third time. In the same way gradually the
fourth and fifth infusion, which is sharp, is taken out: this
they use for vinegar. This wine has thinner particles, and
is inflative and bad for the stomach. It represses the
appetite, is good for the intestines, and urinary. It extracts 
the menstrual flow, and makes milk abundant
[breastfeeding]. It causes bad blood, and is a cause of
elephantiasis, like zythum [soured barley water]. Some also
put ten pints of salt or nine gallons of brine to fifty four
gallons of this liquid, thinking it would be changed and
good for the bowels; and some lay thyme and marathrum
[3-81] in the bottom, then the dry figs, and they do this by
turns until they have filled the jar. It is also called suchiten.

SUGGESTED: Sycomorus antiquorum, Ficus sycomorus
— Sycamore Fig, Sycamore, Mulberry Fig — Sycamore Wine 
Sycamine — old English for Mulberry 
European Sycamore is Maple e.g. Acer campestre, the Field Maple or Hedge Maple.
Wine from sycamores is made the same way. It turns 
to sharp vinegar because it is not able to keep the
sweetness of the liquid that flows from them. 
5-43. OINOS RETINITES
SUGGESTED: Picea abies, Pinus mugo — Retinites 
— Rosin from Spruce Firs, Pines  — Rosin Wine 
Rosin wine is made in many nations. It is abundant in
Galatia because the grapes remain unripe because of
the cold, and the wine grows sour if it is not mixed with
Picea resina [spruce]. The rosin is pounded with the bark,
and a quarter pint is mixed to nine gallons of wine; some
strain it after it is boiled, taking away the rosin; others
leave it alone. Growing old, these become sweet. They all
cause headaches and vertigo, and yet are digestive and
urinary. They are good for those with dripping mucus
and coughs, for the abdominal cavity, dysentery, dropsy,
and women's menstrual flows, and it is a syringe for deep
ulcers. The black is more binding than the white.
5-44. STROBILITES
SUGGESTED: Pinus mugo —  Pinecone Wine
Strobilites is made from new bruised pinecones steeped 
in must [grape pulp]. It has the same effects as
resinatum [5-43]. Pinecones steeped in must and boiled
are good taken copiously as a drink for pulmonary
tuberculosis.

5-45. OINOS KEDRINOS
SUGGESTED: Cedar Wine, Juniper Wine, Cypress Wine,
 Bay Wine, Pine Wine, Fir Wine
Cedar, juniper, cypress, bay, pine or fir wines are
made the same way. Separate the newly cut wood
when it gives out fruit, lay it in a bath in the sun or near
the fire so that it may sweat, and then mix one pound of
this to four and a half litres of wine. Mix it and leave it
alone for two months. Then put it in another jar, and
having placed in the sun for a while, put it in smaller jars.
We must fill up the jars of wines made like this, for if we
do not they grow sour. Nevertheless these medicinal
wines are unfit for the healthy. They are all warming,
urinary, and somewhat astringent. That of bay is the
most warming. A wine is also made from the fruit of the
bigger cedars. Mix half a pound of bruised cedar berries
to four and a half litres of must and keep it in the sun for
four days, and after all this strain it and pour it into
another jar. 
5-46. OINOS ARKEUTHIDITES 
SUGGESTED: Juniperus communis — Juniper Wine

Cedrites is made as follows. Wash the cedar rosin with
sweet water, and place in each nine-litre container a
winecupful apiece [of rosin], and then fill it with must
[grape pulp]. This is also warming and reduces the
intensity of symptoms. It is good for a cough without a
fever, disorders of the chest and the sides, griping, ulcers
in the stomach and the intestines, as well as for purulent
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK
 767

spitters, dropsy, and womb disorders. It is good for
worms and shivering, it helps those bitten by snakes, and
kills snakes, and dropped in the ears it heals their
disorders. 
5-48. OINOS PISSITES
SUGGESTED: Pissites — Pinus mugo — Pine — Pitch Wine 
Vinum picatum is made of moist pitch and must [grape
pulp]. First wash the pitch in seawater or brine until
it turns white and the seawater runs clean, and then
wash it in sweet water. To eight gallons of must add one
or two ounces of pitch and let it stand. After it has boiled
and is settled put it in jars. It is warming, digesting,
cleansing, and purging — suitable to be used for
disorders of the chest, bowels, liver, and spleen, as well as 
disorders of the womb if there is no fever. It is used for
deep ulcers, and long-lasting discharges. It is good for
coughs, slow digestion, gaseousness, asthmas, and
dislocations (especially) applied with unwashed wool. 
5-49. OINOS APSINTHITES
SUGGESTED: Artemisia absinthium, Absinthium vulgare

pound of Pontic wormwood with forty eight pints
[Italian amphoras] of water and boil it until a third is left.
Afterwards they pour on it six pints of must [grape pulp]
and half a pound of wormwood. Then having mixed
them carefully they put it in a jar and strain it out when it
is settled.  Others put a pound of wormwood into nine
gallons of must, beat it, and binding it in a thin linen
cloth, leave it alone for two months.  Others put three or
four ounces of wormwood and two ounces each of Syrian 
nard [1-6, 1-7, 1-8, 1-10], cinnamon, cassia, flowers of
juncus odoratus  [4-52, 1-16], and Phoenicean dates into
nine gallons of must, beat them in a mortar (afterwards
corking it tightly) and leave it alone for two or three
months. Then it is strained, placed in other jars and
 768

stored. Others put fourteen ounces of Celtic nard [1-7]
and forty ounces of wormwood, binding it in a linen
cloth, into a metreta [? measure] of must, and after forty
days store it in other jars. 
Others put one pound of wormwood and two ounces
of dry pine rosin into twenty pints of must, and after ten
days they strain it and put it in jars. It is good for the
stomach and urinary, good for slow digestion, the
liverish, for kidney disorders and jaundice, for those who 
lack appetite, stomach complaints, long-lasting
distension from hypochondria [ nervous gastric
disorder], gaseousness, roundworms, and for the
restrained menstrual flow. It is good for drinking down
with ixium [3-103], taken copiously as a drink and
vomited up again.
5-50. OINOS USSOPITES
SUGGESTED: Hyssopus officinalis — Hyssop Wine
The best hyssop wine is that which is made from
Cilician hyssop. It is made like absinthites [above]. Put 
one pound of bruised hyssop leaves (wrapped in a thin
linen cloth) into nine gallons of must and also put in small 
stones so that the bundle subsides to the bottom. After
forty days strain it and put it in another jar. It is good for
disorders in the chest, side, and lungs, and for old
coughs, and asthma. It is diuretic, good for griping, and
the periodical chills of fevers, and it induces the

psychotrophon. Take the herb when it is full of ripe
seed together with its branches, put one pound into two
gallons of wine, leave it alone for seven months, and then 
put it in another jar. It is good for many disorders within,
as much as the plant itself. Generally all the additive
wines receive the strength of the things added; therefore
to those who understand them, it is easy to guess the
strength of the wines. The use of wines is for the
unfeverish. Vinegar made of this cestrum is useful for
similar disorders.

 Heracleum gummiferum, Heracleum pubescens,
Heracleum pyrenaicum — Downy Cow Parsnip
Put one ounce of panax [opopanax, 3-55] into four and a
half litres of must [for several months], and then
pour it into another jar. It is good for convulsions,
hernias, bruises, and orthopnoea [form of asthma]; it
reduces the thickness of the spleen, and is good for
griping, sciatica, and slow digestion. It expels the
menstrual flow, and is good for dropsy, and for those
bitten by venomous creatures.

Abortion Wine 
POISONOUS
A wine is made that destroys embryos, for among the
vines planted there is planted veratrum [4-150,
4-151], wild cucumber or scammony, from which the
grapes take the strength; and the wine made from [the
grapes growing near] them becomes destructive. Eight
cups mixed with water is given to women fasting, having
first vomited. 
5-78. OINOS THUMELAITES
SUGGESTED: Thymelaea hirsuta, Daphne gnidium

Throw thirty teaspoons of the branches of thymelaea
(together with its fruit) into two gallons of must. Boil
it, seething it gently, until only one and a third gallons are 
left, then strain it and bottle it. It purges watery matter
and reduces the spleen.

Cut the bark of the roots into pieces, pierce half a
pound of them through with a thread, and put them 
into nine gallons of must for three months. Afterwards
store it in another jar. A weak dose is a quarter pint. It is
taken as a drink with double the amount of passum [raisin
wine] added to it. They say that half a pint of it, mixed
with six pints [of raisin wine] and taken as a drink, brings
one into a heavy, deep sleep. And that one winecupful
(taken as a drink with a pint of wine) kills. The moderate
use of it takes away the sense of pain, and thickens
outflows of body fluids, and either inhaled or given as a
enema it does the same.

after supper. Or bind twenty teaspoons of veratrum,
twelve ounces of juncus [4-52, 1-16], and thirteen ounces
of Syrian spica [1-6, 1-7, 1-8, 1-10] (all sifted) in a linen
cloth, and put them into seven pints of wine from Coon
for forty days. After straining it give three quarters of a
pint to drink. Or else steep six pounds of white hellebore

for forty days in six pints of boiled seawater, and having
strained it, use it. Or steep twelve teaspoons of hellebore
and four teaspoons of saltpetre in six pints of must for
fifteen days, then strain it and use it after six months. This 
also causes infants to abort [abortifacient]. 
Or else take nine gallons of must made from raisins
dried in the sun, throw twenty teaspoons of gypsum into
the must and leave it alone for two days. Then add thirty
ounces of black hellebore (tied in a knot) thirty ounces of
calamus [1-17, 1-114], thirty ounces of juncus odoratus
[4-52, 1-16], one and a half-pints of juniper berries, and an 
ounce each of myrrh [1-77, 1-73, 4-116] and saffron,
having bound them in a linen cloth. Hang them in the
wine for forty days, then strain it, mix it with water, and
give two or three winecupfuls to drink. It purges women
after childbirth and abortions, is an abortifacient, and is
available for womb strangulation.

METALLIC STONES
5-84. KADMEIA
SUGGESTED: Cadmium Earth — Cadmia 
The best cadmia is the Cyprian called botryites, which is
thick and not very heavy, but rather inclining to
lightness, with the outside in clusters, coloured like
ashes, but ashy and rusty within when broken. The next
best is an azure [blue] colour on the outside and whiter
within with veins like an onyx stone. These are dug out of 
old mines. There is another type called placodes with veins 
(or stripes) like girdles, which is why they called it zonitis.
There is another type called ostracitis, slender and mostly
black, with an earthy or baked clay outside; but the white
cadmia is useless. Botryitis and onychitis are useful for eye
medicines, and the rest for plasters and dry medicines
that are able to make a new skin. For these things the
Cyprian is the best to use. That which is brought out of
Macedonia, Thrace or Spain is useless. It is binding —
filling up sores, and cleaning their foulness. It stops
discharges of the pores, and dries, draws to a scab, and
represses abnormal growths of the flesh, and creates a
new skin on malignant ulcers.
Cadmia also comes from brass made red-hot in a
furnace, from the soot sticking to the sides and top of the
furnaces. Sticks of iron of a great size (called acestides by
the metalworkers) are joined together at the top so that
the particles that are carried up from the brass may be
attached and settle there. Adhering together they grow
into a clump, and sometimes one kind of it, sometimes
two or all are made. It is also made from a burned stone
called purites [pyrites]dug out of a hill that lies over Solis.
And in the same mound are found (as it were) some veins 
of chalcitis, misy, sory, melanteria, coeruleus, chrysocolla,
calcanthus and diphryges. Some say that cadmia is found in
metals growing in stones, but they are deceived by the
stones having a great resemblance, as in the case of a
stone found at Cumae that has no strength. They are
recognised because they are lighter than cadmia, and
chewed, they are not mild to the taste but offend the
teeth as if stones were being chewed. Cadmia remains
 781
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

chewable as it has a yielding nature. It is also discerned as
follows. Cadmia (pounded into small pieces, made into a
paste with vinegar and dried in the sun) comes together,
but that from stone does not allow this. Also the stone,
broken and put into fire leaps, and the smoke that comes
from it is like the fire; the cadmia remains quiet and yields
smoke that is a yellowish brassy colour surrounding
various other colours. Furthermore the stone, burnt and
cooled again, is altered in colour and lighter. The cadmia
alters in no respect unless you burn it for many days. It is
also made in the furnaces for silver — paler and lighter —
but less effective. They burn the previously mentioned
cadmia, covering it in coals until it becomes transparent
and casts out flaming sparks as plates of iron do, then it
must be quenched in Aminaean wine. That which is for
scabies [ itchy parasitical disease] medicines, must be
quenched in vinegar. Some beat finely again that which
was burnt, mix it with wine, and burn it again in an
unfired clay jar until it is made to look like pumice. Then,
beating it small again and mixing it with wine, they burn
it a third time until it is formed perfectly into ashes
without any roughness, and they use this instead of
spodium [calcinated powder]. Being pounded with water
in a mortar, the water then poured away until no filth
remains on it washes it; then it is made into balls and put
in jars.
5-85. POMPHOLUX
SUGGESTED: Zinc Oxide — Pompholyx
Pompholyx differs from spodium [calcinated powder]
specifically, as it has not a general difference. For the
spodos is somewhat black and for the most part heavier as
it is full of lumps, hairs and earth, because it is the
scrapings and shavings from the floors and hearths in the 
brass refiners’ shops. Pompholyx is fat, white and
altogether very light, so that it can fly into the air. There
are two kinds of this; one is the colour of the air and
somewhat fat. The other is very white and the most light.
Pompholyx becomes white during the working and
finishing of the brass when the brass refiners sprinkle on
crumbled cadmia [5-84] thickly, wanting to have it better;
for the smoke that is carried up from this is very white
 782
METALLIC STONES

and is turned into pompholyx.  Pompholyx is not only made
from working brass and from its substance, but also from
cadmia intentionally blown with the bellows to
manufacture it. It is made as follows. In a house with a
ceiling and roof, a chimney is built and near it towards
the loft, a suitable window. It is open at the parts above.
The wall of the house next to the chimney is drilled
through with a small hole into the furnace for holding the 
bellows. It has also a proper door made for the workman
to go in and come out. Joined to this room is another
room, in which the bellows and the bellows blower work. 
Then coals are put into the furnace and kindled,
afterwards the workman standing by sprinkles on cadmia, 
pounded into small pieces, from overhead. The servant
that is below also does the same and puts on more coals,
until all the cadmia [5-84] that was applied is used up.
Thus burnt the thin light part is carried into the upper
room and sticks to the walls and to the roof. The
substance of those particles (carried up at first) is indeed
like bubbles standing on water, but upon increasing it is
like wool fleeces. The heavier particles fall underfoot and
are spread about, some into the furnace and some to the
floor of the house. This is thought to be worse than the
thin particles, because it is earthy and full of filth from
gathering it. Some think that the previously mentioned
spodos is only made this way. It is thought that the
Cyprian (which, worked into a paste with vinegar, has
the smell of brass) is the best. The colour is pitchy, and
furthermore it is like dirt to the taste. When pure it boils if  
it is put on a burning coal, becoming an airy colour. We
must carefully observe the signs previously mentioned,
for it is counterfeited with bulls’ glue, or lambs’ lungs,
with lungs of the sea [jellyfish], or with burnt green figs
and some other similar things. These are easily perceived
for none of the previously mentioned tests work on
them.
Pompholyx is commonly washed as follows. Having
bound it (either dry or made into a paste with water) in a
moderately thin clean linen cloth put it into a basin
containing rain water, and plunge it about in there
carrying the knot this way and that way so that the slimy
matter and the stuff which is good can run out, but all the
refuse will remain in the cloth. Then allow it to settle,
strain out the water with the ashes, and pour on other
water again. Roll it about, and then pour it out and repeat
 783
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

this procedure, both straining and pouring it out until no
sandy matter subsides. Finally strain out the water, dry
the ashes, and put them in jars. 
Some dry it as much as possible, squeeze it in their
hands with water to a honeyish consistency, and strain it
through a linen cloth spread over the jar that is to receive
it. The mixture is not too stiff so that it may easily pass
through. They then pour water abundantly on the linen
cloth to disturb the ashes, then with a spoon they take up
the strained frothy stuff swimming on top which they
store in a new ceramic jar. Gently straining that which
has settled, they pour it into another jar, while the sandy
matter is left at the bottom. Again, allowing the stony
substance to subside, they strain it into another clean jar
and they do this often until the ashes become clean and
without sand. 
Others wet it as it is, a whole piece in the water, little
by little, thinking that the previously mentioned sand
and stony matter would fall by its own weight to the
bottom of the jar and that the filaments, specks and
similar things would be lifted on top by their lightness.
Then separating the ashes which are in the middle and
throwing them into a mortar, they wash them like cadmia
[5-84]. It is also washed with Chian [from Scios in the
Aegean sea] wine diluted with seawater as previously
mentioned, and this is more astringent than that washed
with water. Pompholyx is astringent, cooling, filling,
purging, and somewhat drying. Spodium [calcinated
powder] should be roasted after first being carefully and
finely pounded. Then sprinkle it with water, make
lozenges with it and put them in a new ceramic jar. Place
this on a small, gentle coal fire and turn the little balls
continuously until they become red and dry. It should be
mentioned that spodium [calcinated powder] is also made
out of gold and silver, and furthermore also from lead;
that from lead is the best, then that from copper.
5-86. ANTISPODA
SUGGESTED: Ashes used instead of Spodium [5-85]
Since spodium is often not available and antispodia are
very good to use, it is necessary both to show what
they are, which of them are of equal strength, and how
 784
METALLIC STONES

they should be taken. Take therefore myrtle [1-155, 4-146] 
leaves with the flowers and unripe myrtle berries, put
them into an unfired clay jar, and having sealed the cover 
and pierced it through with many holes, put it into a
potter’s furnace. When the jar is well baked, put [the
myrtle] into another unfired jar, and when this second jar 
is thoroughly baked, take it out, wash it and use it. In the
same way take a branch of an olive, but let it be from the
wild; but if not, from the cultivated olive with the
flowers; and if not this, quinces cut in pieces and the pith
taken out; or [oak] galls, linen rags, unripe white
mulberries dried beforehand in the sun, lentisk [1-90],
terminthos [1-91] shoots or buds, the tender leaves of
bramble, or the filaments of box, or that which is called
false cypress together with its flowers. Some prepare
branches of the fig tree first dried in the sun, but others
use bulls’ glue; some prepare rough unwashed wool,
moistening it with pitch or honey. All the previously
mentioned ashes are useful in that they may serve
instead of spodium [calcinated powder]. 
5-87. CHALKOS KEKUMENOS
SUGGESTED: Burnt Brass
Burnt brass is good if it is red, and when rubbed looks
like cinnabar [red or crystalline mercuric sulphide].
The black burnt brass is burnt more than necessary. It is
made from the nails of broken ships laid together in an
unfired clay pot (sulphur first scattered underneath) with 
the same amount of salt, and layers applied one over the
other by turn. The pot is corked and smeared with
potter’s clay, then put into a furnace until it has baked
thoroughly. Instead of sulphur and salt, some sprinkle
about allom [5-123]. Without using either sulphur or salt
some place the nails together into the pot and burn them
for many days; some use sulphur alone. These nails must
have the soot wiped from them. Others rub the nails with 
alumen [5-123] in small pieces together with sulphur and
vinegar, and burn it in an unfired clay pot. Some sprinkle
them with vinegar in a brass pot, then burn them. After
the nails are burnt this way, they repeat the procedure
three times, then they put the residue in jars. That which
is burnt in Memphis is the best, then that from Cyprus. It
 785
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

is suitable as an astringent, to dry, relieve, repress, attract, 
clean, form a skin over ulcers, wear off things growing in
the eyes, consume the overgrown flesh of a healing
wound, and stop gangrenous ulcers. It will also induce
vomiting, a decoction taken as a drink with honey water,
licked with honey, or smeared on. It is washed like cadmia
[5-84], the water changed four times a day until no froth
stands on top. The dregs (washed the same way) have the 
same property but are somewhat weaker. 
5-88. CHALKOU ANTHOS
SUGGESTED: Flowers of Brass
The flowers of brass, which some of the ancients called
psegma [ ramentum — shavings] are best if they are
very brittle and very red when crushed finely; and like
millet in size — small, heavy and mildly glittering — and
besides, not containing any dust of brass with which it is
counterfeited. The powder spreading out when crushed
by the teeth allows one to discern it.  It is made as follows.
When the brass that is melted in metallic furnaces runs
through the colanders of the adjoining pipes into the
receptacles, those who supervise take away the scum,
and pour on the purest water intending to cool it. The
previously mentioned flower of brass is 'spit out' (as it
were) as a result of this sudden thickening and
hardening. This is therapeutic for the bowels, represses
abnormal growths, and wears off those things that
darken the sight of the eyes as it is excessively biting. If
forty grains are given it extracts thick fluids. It consumes
abnormal growths of flesh in the nostrils, and with wine
it represses pustules on the perineum. White flowers of
brass are blown into the ears through a pipe for deafness
that has lasted a long time. It is beaten finely and applied
with honey to repress the tonsils and uvula.
5-89. LEPIS
SUGGESTED: Brass Scales 
Squama is also called helitis and is made from Cyprian
brass nails. It is thick and good; but that made from
white brass is thin and weak and we refuse it, preferring
 786
METALLIC STONES

that which is thick and shiny and turns rusty when
vinegar is sprinkled on it. It is contractive and reduces the 
intensity of symptoms of noma [grazer disease, eats away
muscle, tissue and bones], repressing putrification and
forming new skins. A decoction (taken as a drink with
honey and water) expels fluids. Some work it into a paste
with meal and give it as a catapotium [pill]. It is also mixed
with medicines for the eyes as it dries eyelids that are
rough, removing rheum [excessive fluids]. 
It is washed as follows: clean half a pound of dry brass 
scales [flakes], put them into a mortar with clear water,
stir them up and down carefully by hand until the scum
sinks down, and throw away the remainder. Having
poured out the water, pour in one wine cup of rain water, 
and with the palm of the hand rub it hard in the mortar
(as if you were straining it), and when it begins to send
out viscousness, little by little pour on water (as much as
six cups) beating it strongly. Take the squama with your
hand against the side of the mortar, press it hard, and
having pressed it take that which has run out into a red
brass box, for this is the flower of squama. It is very potent
and very effective for eye medicines. The rest has no
strength. Yet, washing that which remains in the same
way, work it until it shows no glueyness. Having covered
it with a linen cloth, you must let it stand still for two
days. Then pour out the water that stands on top, dry the
remains and put it in a box. Some wash it like cadmia
[5-84] and put it in jars. 
5-90. LEPIS STOMOMATOS
UNKNOWN: stoma is a little mouth
Scales [flakes] of stomoma have the same strength as
scales [flakes] of brass, and their washing and storage
are the same; but in purging the bowels they are less
effective than that of brass. 
5-91. IOS XUSTOS
SUGGESTED: Verdigris — Brass Oxide
Aerugo rasilis [verdigris — brass oxide] is prepared as
follows. Pour the sharpest vinegar into a cask or
 787
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

some similar jar and place over it a brass jar. It is good if
the hollow faces downward — if not, let it be flat. It must
be clean and leave no space for air. After ten days take off
the cover and scrape off the aerugo [verdigris — brass
oxide] that has grown on it. Or, having made a plate of
the brass itself hang it in the jar so as not to touch the
vinegar, and after the same number of days scrape it off.
Or, hide one piece or plate or more among the husks of
grapes (not pressed recently but turning sour) inverted
the same way. It may also be made from filings of brass, or 
the plates between which leaves of gold are held when
pounded out if one sprinkles them with vinegar, then
turns them three or four times until they are rusty all
over. They say that this rust is obtained in the Cyprian
mines in two ways; flourishing on some stones
containing brass, and secondly dropping out of a certain
cavern in the scorching weather on the hottest days. The
former is only a little quantity and very good, but that
from the cavern, though it flows out in abundance and
has a good colour, is worthless because it is mixed with
stony matter.  
It is counterfeited by the addition of many other
things, especially with the following. Some mix it with
pumice stone, some with marble, and others with
calcanthum [limestone]. You can discern the pumice stone 
and marble by wetting the thumb of the left hand and
rubbing some part of the rust with the other, because the
rust in it spreads out while the particles of pumice stone
and marble remain undissolved. At last it turns white
after long rubbing and with the addition of the moisture.
Also decide by crushing it with your teeth, for the
unmixed breaks down smooth and not rough. The
addition of calcanthum [limestone] is discerned by fire. If
you sprinkle the rust thus counterfeited on a plate or
ceramic jar and put either of these in warm ashes or on
coals, that made with calcanthum [limestone] is changed
and grows red because it usually has such a colour when
it is burnt.
 788
METALLIC STONES

5-92. IOS SKOLEX
SUGGESTED: Scolecia — Rust 
RISK OF BLOOD POISONING
There are two types of rust called scolecia; for the one is
a mineral and the other is made as follows. Pour a
quarter pint of white sharp vinegar into a mortar made
from Cyprian brass, and with a pestle made of the same
material beat it until it is viscous. Then add one teaspoon
each of ground allom [5-123] and transparent mineral salt
or sea salt (as white and strong as possible) and if not, the
same amount of saltpetre [potassium nitrate]. Then beat
them together in the sun in the extreme heat of the
hottest days until the mixture becomes rusty in colour but 
gluey in consistency. Then make it into little worms like
rhodianda [? stamens of roses] and put it in jars. It is made
effectively and with a good colour if one part of vinegar
and two parts of old urine are used and processed as
previously mentioned. 
Some mix that which is useless with aerugo rasilis
[5-91], form it into a shape with gum and sell it. This is to
be refused as worthless. A type of rust is also a made by
the goldsmiths with a Cyprian brass mortar and pestle
and a child’s urine, with which they solder gold. The
previously mentioned rusts are commonly similar to
burnt brass. They are stronger in effect. It should be
mentioned that the dug-up or mined scolecia [rust] is the
best, next to that is the scraped or smooth, and then the
manufactured. This last is more biting and astringent but
that from the goldsmiths is similar to the scraped or
smooth. All rust is suitable as an astringent, to warm, to
wear off and relieve scars in the eyes, to draw tears, stop
gangrenous ulcers, keep wounds from inflammation,
and form a skin over ulcers with oil and wax. Boiled with
honey they purge callos [pus under a hard skin] and foul
ulcers. Taken with amoniacum [3-98] the same way as eye
salves or suppositories, they remove fistulas and their
callos. They are good for abnormal growths, and
protuberances of the gums; rubbed on with honey they
greatly lessen [swollen] eyelids. After rubbing you must
bathe with a sponge and warm water. Taken with
terminthos [1-91] rosin, brass or saltpetre [potassium
nitrate] they take away leprosy. 
 789
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

Rust is burnt as follows. Break it into very small
pieces, put it in a ceramic platter, set it over burning coals
and stir it around until it changes and looks a somewhat
ashy colour, then cool it, put it in jars and use it. Some
burn it in an unfired clay jar, as previously described, but
burnt like this it will not change altogether into the same
colour. 
5-93. IOS SIDEROU
SUGGESTED: Iron Rust
CAN CAUSE BLOOD INFECTIONS ON OPEN CUTS
Iron rust is astringent, and applied it stops women's
excessive discharges [ menstrual flow]. A decoction
(taken as a drink) causes inconception [birth control], and 
rubbed on with vinegar it heals rashes such as measles. It
is suitable to use for whitlows, pterygium [membrane on
eye], scabbed eyelids, and venereal warts, and it
strengthens the gums. Rubbed on it helps gout, and
thickens loss of hair [ alopecia]. Iron made burning hot
then quenched in water or wine, and the liquid (taken as
a drink) is good for the abdominal cavity, dysentery,
spleen, cholera, and diarrhoea. 
5-94. SKORIA SIDEROU
SUGGESTED: Iron Slag
Scoria [slag] of iron is suitable for as many things as rust 
from iron but to a lower degree. Taken as a drink with 
vinegar and honey [ antidote] it helps aconitum [4-77,
4-78].
5-95. MOLUBDOS PEPLUMENOS
SUGGESTED: Washed Lead  — Molybdos [Greek] — Lead
Molybdomenite — Selenite of Lead  
TOXIC
Washed lead is prepared as follows. Place water into
a lead mortar and beat it with a lead pestle until
the water becomes black and muddy. Then strain it
 790
METALLIC STONES

through a linen cloth, pouring on more water, so that all
that which is dissolved may be strained. Repeat the
procedure until it seems that you have enough, then
letting that which is washed settle, pour out that water
and pour in other water, as in the case of cadmia [5-84],
and wash it until no blackness remains on it. Then make
tablets from it and put it in jars. Some sprinkle water onto
clean lead, beat it in a stone mortar with a stone pestle or
by hand, pouring on water little by little underhand.
When that which has turned black has been allowed to
settle they pour it out and form it into tablets
immediately. For that which is rubbed longer becomes
like cerussa [white lead ore]. Some put a little plumbago
[5-100] into the lead dust saying that lead washed this
way is better. 
It is able to cool, and is an astringent to close the pores, 
fill up sores and wounds, and deter fluids that gather in
the eyes, and fleshy abnormal growths of ulcers. It is also
a blood stauncher, and is good used with rosaceum [1-53]
for ulcers on the perineum, venereal warts, and
haemorrhoids. It is also used for sores that will not heal,
and in general it treats the same things as spodium
[calcinated powder] without raising a scab. Unmixed
lead is rubbed on to help the strike of a sea scorpion [2-14] 
or sea dragon [2-15].
5-96. MOLUBDOS KEKAUMENOS
SUGGESTED: Burnt Lead 
 TOXIC
Lead is burnt as follows. Take plates of lead (as thin as
possible), put them into a new pot and sprinkle
sulphur on them, and place layers of lead plates and
sulphur until you have filled the pot. Then start a fire
underneath. When the lead is kindled, stir it with an iron
rod until it is perfectly turned into ashes and has nothing
leadlike in it. Then take it out (having closed your
nostrils, for the vapour is harmful), throw this dust of
lead and sulphur into a pot, and burn it. Some throw the
plates into an unfired clay jar, put it into a furnace or over
coals (sealing the cover with soft clay and giving it a little
breathing place [hole]), and burn it. Some sprinkle cerussa
[white lead ore] or barley on it instead of sulphur. Some
 791
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

place the plates in without any admixture, use a sharp
fire, and stir it around lustily with an iron rod until it
turns to ashes. Burning it like this is difficult, and burned
too much it takes on the colour of lithargyrum [5-102]. The
first method pleases me. We must wash it as we do cadmia
[5-84] and put it in jars. It has the same uses that the
washed lead has but is far stronger.
5-97. SKORIA MOLUBDOU
SUGGESTED: Lead Slag 
TOXIC
The best lead slag [scoria] looks like cerussa [white lead
ore], thick and hard to break with no trace of lead in
it, yellowish in colour and glistening like glass. It is good
for the same things as burnt lead but is more astringent. It 
is washed in a mortar, with water poured on and that
which remains on top is a yellowish colour when poured
out. This is done often until the scoria [slag] is used up.
Then after allowing it to settle we pour out the water and
make it into tablets.
5-98. MOLUBDOEIDES LITHOS
SUGGESTED: Lead Stone 
 TOXIC
Lead stone has the same properties as scoria [slag] and
is washed in the same way.
5-99. STIMMI
SUGGESTED: Stibium — Trisulphide of Antimony, 
Black Antimony
The best stibium is the brightest — shining, crusty
when broken, with no earthiness or foulness, and
quickly broken. It is able to close the pores, and is
astringent and cooling, repressing fleshy abnormal
growths, forming new skins on ulcers, and cleaning filth
and ulcers in the eyes. It stops discharges of blood that
come from the meninx [brain and spinal cord]. Generally
 792
METALLIC STONES

its properties are like burnt lead. In particular it will not
let burns form a scab rubbed on with new grease, and it
forms skin over sores grown to scabs if some wax and a
little cerussa [white lead ore] is mixed with it. It is roasted
— wrapped around with dough and hidden in coals until 
the dough has turned to a coal. When taken out it is
quenched with the milk of a woman that bears a male
child or with old wine. It is further burnt: applied to coals
and blown until it flames, for if it is burnt more it melts
like lead. It is washed like cadmia [5-84] and brass, but
some wash it like lead scoria [slag]. Some have called this
stibi, platyophthalmon, larbason, gynoecion, or chalcedonium.
5-100. MOLUBDAINA
SUGGESTED: Silver Salts and Gold Salts
Plumbago — Molybdos [Greek] — Lead — in this manuscript
Molybdomenite — Selenite of Lead
TOXIC.
Old English — Plumbago is native or mineralised carbon. Molybdenum is a metallic
element — a silvery metal — symbol Mo. Molybdenite is disulphide of
Molybdenum.
The best plumbago looks like frothy silver — yellow,
somewhat glittering, and a tawny yellow when
pounded into small pieces. Boiled with oil it becomes like
liver in colour. That which is an airy or lead colour is
worthless. It is made from silver and gold, and there is
some found which is dug out of the earth about Sebastia
and Corycum. The best of this is neither like scoria [slag],
nor stony, but yellow and glittering. It has properties like
lithargyrum [5-102] and [slag] of lead, and is washed and
burnt the same way. It is most effectively mixed with
gentle plasters called lipara, and is effective with plasters
that are not corrosive — promoting the growth of flesh in
a wound or sore, and forming new skin. It is not suitable
for those plasters that close open cuts and clean.
 793
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

5-101. SKORIA ARGUROU
SUGGESTED: Silver Slag
Scoria [slag] of silver is called helcysma or encauma. It has
the same strength as plumbago [5-100]; as a result it is
mixed with black plasters, and those for forming new
skin, as it is extractive [draws out] and astringent.
5-102. LITHARGUROS
SUGGESTED: Lithargyrum, Litharge — Monoxide of Lead 
Monoxide of Silver and Monoxide of Molybdenum
TOXIC
Some spuma argenti or froth of silver is made from sand
called molibditis [molybdenite — disulphide of
molybdenum] blown in a furnace until perfectly fired.
Some is made from silver and some from lead. The
Attican is best, next to this is the Spanish, after these that
from Dicaearchia in Campania and from Sicily, for much
of it is made in these various places from lead plates that
are fired. The best is a yellow glittering sort called
chrysitis; that from Sicily is called argyritis [silver], and
that from silver is called calabritis. It is astringent and
softening, filling up hollownesses, repressing abnormal
growths of flesh, and forming new skins; as well as being
cooling, and closing the pores. You should burn it as
follows. Divide it into pieces the size of carya [1-178], place 
them on burning coals, and blow on them until
thoroughly fired. Then wipe away the filth that has
formed on it and put it in jars. Some quench it three times
with vinegar or wine then burn it again, and having done 
these things, put it in jars. It is washed like cadmia [5-84]. 
It is made white as follows. Take as much as an
Athenian choenix [two pints] of that which is called
argyritis [silver] (and if not, then one of the others) broken 
into pieces the size of beans, and throw it into a new
ceramic jar. Pour on water and throw in two pints  of
white wheat as well. Take a handful of barley, bind it in a
thin clean linen cloth, hang it from the handle of the
ceramic jar, and boil it until the barley is broken. Then
pour it all out into a clean broad-mouthed plate, separate
the wheat, and throw it away. Pour on water to wash the
 794
METALLIC STONES

sediment, rubbing it strongly at the same time with your
hands. Then take it out, dry it, and beat it in a Thebaean
mortar, pouring on warm water until it has dissolved.
Straining out the water, pound it again for a whole day,
and in the evening pour on hot water then leave it alone.
In the morning strain out that water, pour in more, and
repeat this procedure three times a day. Do this for seven
days. Then mix to a pound of lithargyrum five
teaspoonfuls of mineral salt, pour on warm water and
beat it three times a day, straining out the old water and
mixing in new water each time. Even if it turns white
pour on warm water until it contains no saltiness. Dry it
in a very hot sun (first throwing away the liquid) then put 
it in jars. 
Alternatively, take one pound of argyritis [silver], beat
it into small pieces carefully, and mix in three times as
much mineral salt, also pounded into small pieces. Put it
into a new ceramic jar, and add water until it is covered.
Stir it every day, morning and evening, pouring in in
more water as needed, but pouring out none of the
original water. Do this for thirty days for if it is not stirred
it becomes as hard as a shell. Afterwards (having poured
out the salt water) gently beat the sediment finely in a
Thebaean mortar. Put it into a ceramic jar, pour in water,
and stir it diligently with your hands, pouring out the
first water and pouring on more until it has no saltiness.
Then pour out the white lithargyrum into another jar,
make lozenges with it, and keep them in a lead box. 
Some break the sediment into pieces the size of beans, 
place them into the raw intestines of a swine, and boil it in 
water until the intestines have dissolved. Then they take
it out, beat it with the same amount of salt, and wash it as
previously described. Some beat one pound of salt and
the same amount of lithargyrum in the sun with water,
(continuously replacing the water) until it becomes
white. Or, alternatively, take as much lithargyrum as you
want, wrap it in white wool, place it in a new ceramic jar
with water and one handful of clean new beans, and boil
them. When the beans are broken and the wool has
turned black, take out the lithargyrum, wrap it in other
wool, and boil it a second time, adding a winecupful of
water and the same amount of beans, and repeat the
procedure until the wool absorbs no more colour. After
this place it into a mortar, mixing one pound of mineral
salt to eighty Athenian teaspoons of lithargyrum, and beat
 795
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

it finely. Then after a while add forty seven teaspoonfuls
of the very whitest saltpetre washed with water, and beat 
it again until the sediment is sufficiently white. Then
pour it from a height into a broad-mouthed ceramic jar,
add a quantity of water, let it settle, and strain it. Repeat
the procedure until the water that runs over becomes
very clear and sweet, not salty. Finally, put it into a new
ceramic platter (all the liquid having been gently strained
out), set it in the sun forty days during the hottest days,
and having dried it, use it. Lithargyrum that has been
washed seems to be good to put in eye medicines, as well
as for foul scars, wrinkled faces and those full of spots. 
5-103. PSIMUTHIOS
SUGGESTED: Cerussa — White Lead 
TOXIC
Cerussa is made as follows. Pour the sharpest vinegar
into a broad-mouthed jar or ceramic urn, and fasten
a lead plate to the mouth of the jar with a little reed mat
placed underneath. On the top of it put covers so that the
vinegar cannot evaporate before it is dissolved, and falls
down distilled. Strain out the pure liquid on top. Pour the 
viscous stuff out into a jar and dry it in the sun. Then it
must be ground in a hand mill, or finely pounded some
other way and sarced [scraped]. Repeat this pounding
and scraping three or four times. That which is sarced
[scraped] first is the best, to be used in eye medicines, and 
the next best follows next, and so on. Some use a bullrush
mat, fastening it towards the middle of the jar so that it
touches the vinegar. Then they cork the mouth of it, seal
it all up, and leave it alone. After some days they take off
the cover to look in, and when it is all dissolved they
repeat the procedures previously described. To form it
into lozenges, it must be kneaded with sharp vinegar,
shaped, and dried in the sun. The things mentioned here
must be done in the summer for then it becomes white
and effective. 
It is also made in the winter, the ceramic pots set over
furnaces, baths, or chimneys. The warmth is carried from
above, the same as the sun. That which is made in
Rhodes, Corinth or in Lacedaemonia is considered the
best. The next is that which comes from Puteoli. It is
 796
METALLIC STONES

roasted as follows: place a new Ostracean jar (especially
an Athenian) over light burning coals, sprinkle on cerussa
[white lead] pounded into small pieces, and stir it
continuously. When it is ashy in colour take it out, cool it,
and use it. If you want to burn it put the pounded small
pieces into a hollow platter set it over live coals, and stir it
with a stick of ferula until it is similar in colour to sandarac
[5-122] then take it out and use it. If cerussa is washed the
same way as cadmia [5-84] some call this sacyx. Mixed
with stiff ointments, plasters called lipara, and with
lozenges [tablets, but not to take internally] it is cooling,
pore-closing, softening, filling, reduces the intensity of
symptoms; and furthermore gently represses abnormal
growths, and forms new skins; it is among those things
which taken internally kill. 
5-104. CHRUSOKOLLA
SUGGESTED: Chrysocolla 
This was a name for Borax or Malachite and means Gold Solder. 
TOXIC
Chrysocolla from Armenia is the best — considerably
resembling leeks in colour; that from Macedonia is
the second, then the Cyprian. The pure should be
chosen, but that which is full of earth and stones must be
refused. It is washed as follows: pound it, put it into a
mortar, pour on water, and rub it strongly with the palm
of your hand against the mortar. Allow it to settle, strain
it, pour on other water, rub it again, and do this
repeatedly until it is pure and unadulterated. Then dry it
in the sun and put it in jars and use it. If you want to burn
it, do it as follows. Pound as much of it as you need, put it
in a platter, set it over light coals, and repeat the
procedure previously explained about burning.
Chrysocolla is able to wear off scars, and repress fleshy
abnormal growths, and it is cleansing, astringent,
warming, gently corrosive and a little biting. It is one of
the medicines that cause vomiting and are strong enough 
to kill.
 797
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

5-105. ARMENION
SUGGESTED: Armenian Stone — blue Copper Carbonate 
Armenium must be chosen which is smooth, an azure
[blue] colour, very even, without stones, and very
brittle. It does the same things as chrysocolla [above], only
it is not as strong. It is also increases hairs on the eyelids. 
5-106. KUANOS
SUGGESTED: Cyanochroite — blue hydrous Sulphate of
Copper and Potassium
Cyanus, formed from brass minerals, is found in
Cyprus. The largest quantity is made from sand at
the shore that is found near some hollow places of the
sea, like burrows. This is also the best. That which has a
full colour must be chosen. It is burnt like chalcitis
[calcium carbonate] and washed like cadmia [5-84]. It has
the ability to repress, is a little corrosive, forms scabs, and
is ulcerating. 
5-107. INDIKON
SUGGESTED: Indigofera tinctoria, Indigofera indica,
 Indigofera linifolia, Indigofera viscosa — Indigo Plant, 
Dyer’s Indigo Plant 
Indicum forms of its own accord because it seems to be
the froth of Indian reeds. The other forms during the
dyeing when the purple flowers collect on the dye vats.
The workmen take them off and dry them. The best is
azure [blue], juicy and smooth. It is gently astringent,
breaks inflammation and oedema, and purges and
represses ulcers. 
5-108. OCHRA
SUGGESTED: Ochre
Ochre must be chosen which is light and yellow, with 
a rich colour, unstony, and brittle. That from
 798
METALLIC STONES

Athens is like this. We must burn and wash it like cadmia
[5-84]. It is an astringent for putrefying sores, dissolves
inflammation and small swellings, represses abnormal
growths of flesh, fills up sores and wounds (used with
wax ointments), and diminishes calluses.
5-109. KINNABARI
SUGGESTED: red crystalline Mercuric Sulphide — Cinnabar  
Some think cinnabar is the same as that which is called
ammium, but are deceived in this. Ammium is made in
Spain from a certain stone mixed with Arguritidic sand,
and otherwise it is unknown. In the furnace it changes
into a very lively and flaming colour. It has among metals
a choking smell, and therefore the workmen there put
bladders around their faces that they may see but not
inhale the vapour. The painters use this for the
sumptuous adornings of walls. 
Cinnabar (which we speak of) is brought from Africa,
and sold for so much and is so scarce that it is with
difficulty enough for the painters for variety in their lines. 
It is also a heavy or deep colour, as a result some thought
it was the blood of dragons. Cinnabar has the same
properties as haematite, good for eye medicines and even 
more effectively, for it is more astringent and blood
staunching. Taken with wax ointments it heals burns and 
pustules that break out. 
5-110. UDRAGUROS
SUGGESTED: Hydrargyrum — Argentum vivum 
— Mercury — Quicksilver 
TOXIC
Hydrargyrum is made from ammion, which is also
incorrectly called cinnabar [above]. They place an
iron spoon containing ammion in a ceramic pot, cover the
cup daubing it all around with clay, then make a fire
underneath with coals. The soot that sticks to the pot is
scraped off and cooled and becomes hydrargyrum. It is
also found in places where silver is smelted, gathered
together in drops on the roofs. Some say that hydrargyrum
 799
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

is found by itself in the mines. It is kept in glass, lead, tin
or silver jars for it eats through all other matter and runs
out. It is destructive. Taken as a drink it eats through the
internal organs by its weight. This is helped if a lot of milk
is taken as a drink, or wine with wormwood [3-26], a
decoction of smallage, seeds of Salvia horminum ,
origanum, or hyssop [3-30] with wine. (Gold dust, that is,
the smallest scraping, is a miraculous help for
hydrargyrum poisoning).
5-111. MILTOS SINOPIKE
SUGGESTED: Red Ochre from Sinope
The best rubrica Sinopica is thick and heavy, with a
bright colour, without stones, and all one colour,
spreading out much when dissolved. It is gathered in
Cappadocia from certain hollows. It is purified, carried to
the city Sinope (from which it has its name) and sold. It is
drying and adhesive; as a result it is mixed with wound
plasters and drying astringent tablets. Taken in an egg or
as a suppository it stops the intestines. It is also given for
liver disorders. 
5-112. TEKTONIKE
SUGGESTED:  Red Ochre
Tectonic [red ochre] is inferior in every respect to the
Sinopic. The Egyptian and Carthaginian are the best
— without stones and brittle. It is also found in Spain
towards the West. Ochre is burnt and turns into red
ochre.
5-113. LEMNIA GE
SUGGESTED: Lemnian Earth
Lemnian earth is brought from the Island Lemnos out
of a certain hollow cavern in a marshy place. It is
gathered from there and mixed with goats’ blood, and
the men there make it into tablets, seal it with the figure
of a goat and call it the seal of a goat. Taken as a drink
 800
METALLIC STONES

with wine it is a very powerful antidote against deadly
poisons, and taken beforehand it forces one to vomit up
poisons. It is good against strikes and bites from
venomous or poisonous beasts. It is mixed with
antidotes. Some use it for purifications, and it is also good
for dysentery. 
5-114. CHALKANTHON
SUGGESTED: Calcanthum — Limestone
There is a single type of calcanthum formed by
moisture into a solid. It has three different forms. The 
moisture that strained by dripping into certain caves is
formed into a solid from which those who work the
Cypnan metals call stillatitium. Petesius calls it pinarium,
and some call it stalacticon [coalesced, boiled, thin, long
like a spear]. Some runs secretly in hollows, and
afterwards is transported into ditches and thickens, and
this is called pecton. 
The third sort is called coctile and is made in Spain. It
has the following method of manufacture, but is useless
and the weakest. They dilute it in boiling water, and then
pour it out into receptacles to let it stand. After some days
this is thickened and divides into many cubic forms
hanging together like grape bunches. The best is azure
coloured [blue], heavy, compact and transparent, such as
the stillatitium that is also called lanceatum. The next best
is concretitium. Coctile is thought to be the fittest for
dyeing and making colours black, but experience shows
that it is the weakest for medicinal use. It is astringent —
two teaspoonfuls are swallowed or licked with honey to
warm, form scabs, and to kill broadworms. It causes
vomiting and helps those who have eaten mushrooms,
taken as a drink with water. Diluted with water and
dropped into the nostrils through wool it purges the
head. It is burnt, as we will show [below] in calcitis. 
 801
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

5-115. CHALKITIS
SUGGESTED: Calcite — Anhydrous Carbonate of Lime,
 Calcium Carbonate
Calcitis is preferred which looks like brass, brittle,
without stones, and is not old, and furthermore with 
somewhat long glittering veins. It is astringent, warming
and scab forming, purging away filth around the eye
corners and the eyes. It is one of those things that are
mildly astringent. It is good (with the juice of a leek) for
erysipela [ streptococcal skin infection], herpes [ viral skin
infection], and discharges of blood from the womb and
nostrils. The powder of it is good for repressing abnormal 
growths on the gums, and gangrenous ulceration of the
cheeks and tonsils. Burnt, pounded into small pieces and
mixed with honey, it is far more effective for eye
medicines. It reduces and cleans rough eyelids that have
grown hard, and put in like a suppository it takes away
fistulas [ulcers].
5-116. PSORIKON
SUGGESTED: Calcium Carbonate & Cadmium Earth 
— Psoricum 
Psoricum is made of two parts of calcitis [calcium
carbonate] mixed with one of cadmia [5-84], and
pounded into small pieces with vinegar. It must be
tightly shut up in a ceramic jar covered in dung for forty
days, in the hottest days, so it becomes sharper, and it is
good for whatever calcitis is. Some mix the materials in
equal proportions, beat them in wine, and do the same as
before. They burn it by placing it in a new ceramic jar and
setting it over burning coals. Measure the burning this
way: those full of moisture must become without bubbles 
and perfectly dry, and the rest must change into a more
flourishing colour. When it is like blood (or red ochre)
deep within, then it must be taken off. Blow off the filth
on top of it and put it in jars. It is roasted on coals that are
blown [with bellows] until it becomes a pale yellow, or in
a ceramic pot over burning coals and turned often until it
is on fire and changes colour.
 802
METALLIC STONES

5-117. MISU
SUGGESTED: Misy — Copiapite 
— yellow translucent Hydrous Silicate of Iron
Cyprian misy must be chosen — looking like gold,
hard, and if broken a golden colour, glistening like a
star. It has the same strength as chalcitis [5-115], and is
burnt the same way without psoricum [5-116] being
produced from it, differing both in excess and defect.
That from Egypt (compared to others) is the best and
most effective, but for eye medicines it is not comparable
to that previously mentioned. 
5-118. MELANTHERIA
UNKNOWN
Melanteria grows together in the manner of salt at the 
mouths of mines out of which brass is dug, and
some comes from the earthy upper surfaces of these
places. Some is also found that is dug out in Cilicia and in
certain other places. The best is a sulphurous colour
[yellow], smooth, even and clear, and on touching water
it quickly turns black. It is sharp like misy [above].
5-119. SORU
UNKNOWN
Some are deceived, supposing sory to be melanteria
[above], for it is a different thing though not unlike.
Sory is more poisonous and causes nausea. It is found in
Egypt and in other places such as Africa, Spain and
Cyprus. The Egyptian is considered the best — that
which looks blackest when broken, has many holes, is
somewhat fat, and also astringent and poisonous to taste
or smell, overturning the stomach. That which does not
glisten when broken (like misy) is thought to be another
kind and weak. It has the same properties as those
mentioned above and is burnt like them. It heals
toothaches (put into their cavities) and strengthens loose
teeth. Given as a suppository with wine it helps sciatica,
and smeared on with water it extinguishes varos
 803
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

[smallpox pustules]. It is mixed [with other ingredients]
for dying hair black. As a general rule, for these and
almost all others, those which are not burnt are
considered to be stronger than the burnt; except for salt,
wine sediment, saltpetre [potassium nitrate], chalk, and
other similar things which are weak raw, but are more
effective burnt.  
5-120. DIPHRUGES
SUGGESTED: Pyrites — Disilphide of Iron
It is thought that there are three kinds of diphryges. One
is a mineral and is found only in Cyprus. It is dirty and
is taken out of the bottom of places there. After being
taken out it is dried in the sun, then small brushy sticks
are laid all around it and it is burnt. It is called diphryges
because it is dried and burnt and (as it were) roasted in
the sun amid the sticks. 
Another is (as it were) the sediment and dregs of
worked brass, for after pouring around the cold water (as
we explained when discussing flower of brass) and after
taking away the brass, there is found stuff such as this in
the furnace sticking to the bottom of it, with both the
astringent quality and taste of brass. 
The third sort is made as follows. The supervisors
place stones called pyrites into a furnace and they burn it
(as they do chalk) for many days. When the colour
becomes like red ochre they take it out and put it in jars.
Some say that this sort is only made from by-products of
purfiying brass. This is heated in the furnaces, carried
from there into the ditches and burnt there, for it is
deposited around the ditches and is found after taking
away the stones. The best of it is brassy to the taste, looks
rusty, and is astringent and excessively drying to the
tongue. This quality the burnt ochre does not possess,
though some burn it and sell it instead of diphryges. It is
astringent, cleans thoroughly, wipes away, dries,
represses abnormal growths of the flesh, and forms new
skins on malignancies and creeping sores. Taken with
turpentine or wax ointments it dissolves abscesses. 
 804
METALLIC STONES

5-121. ARSENIKON
SUGGESTED: Orpiment — Yellow Arsenic, Realgar 
 — Arsenic disulphide
POISONOUS
Arsenicum is found in the same mines as sandaracha [?]
[5-122]. The best is crusty, gold in colour and with
crusts like fish scales (as it were) lying one over another,
and it is not mixed with any other material. That which is
found in Mysia (which is in Hellespont) is like this. 
There are two kinds: one as mentioned, and the other
in clumps and like sandaracha in colour. It is brought from
Pontus and Cappadocia. It is roasted as follows: place it in 
a new ceramic jar, set it over burning coals and stir it
continuously; and when it is red-hot and has changed
colour, cool it, beat it finely, and put it in jars. It is
antiseptic, astringent, and scab forming with a burning,
strong, biting strength, and it is one of those medicines
that repress abnormal growths and make the hair fall out.
5-122. SANDARACHE
SUGGESTED: Sandarac — Arar Tree, Sandarach Tree 
Callitris quadrivalvus, Thuya articulata  — Juniper GumTree
5-121 indicates however, this sandarac is a mineral, not a gum.
Sandarac is most highly valued which is fully red,
brittle, easily pounded into small pieces, and pure —
looking like cinnabar [5-109] in colour, and also having a
sulphurous smell. It has the same properties and method
of roasting as arsenicum. Used with rosin it heals loss of
hair [alopecia], and with pitch it removes leprous nails. It is 
good with oil for lice infestations, and with grease it
dissolves small swellings. It is also good with rosaceum for
ulcers in the nostrils and mouth, and for other pustules
[1-53], as well as for venereal warts. It is given with mead
[honey wine] to those who spit up rotten matter, and it is
made into an inhalant with rosin for old coughs, the
smoke drawn through a funnel into the mouth. Licked in
with honey it clears the voice, and it is given with rosin in
a catapotion [pill] to the asthmatic.
 805
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

5-123. STUPTERIA
SUGGESTED: Aluminium Sulphate, Potassium Sulphate 
— Alum
Almost every kind of allom is found in the same mines
in Egypt, such as the scissile [capable of being cut or
divided] (as it were) and the flower of Bolitis.  It is also
found in certain other places — in Melos, Macedonia,
Sardinia, Liparis, and Hierapolis in Phrygia, in Africa,
Armenia, and many other places (like red ochre). There
are many kinds of it; but for medicinal use the scissile, the
round, and the moist are taken. The scissile is the best —
especially that which is new, white, without stones, with
a strong smell, very astringent, and furthermore not
compacted together like turf or slate, but opening its
mouth wide like gray hairs spread-apart, such as that
called trichitis, found in Egypt. A stone very like it is also
found, discernable by its not astringent taste. 
The round allom that is made by hand should not be
taken. It is known by its shape; but that to be taken is
naturally round, full of bladders, somewhat white, and
strongly binding, and also has some paleness together
with fattiness, and additionally it is both without stones
and brittle, and it originates in Melia or Egypt. 
Moist [alum] that is most transparent must be chosen
— milky, even, and juicy throughout, and furthermore
without stones and giving out a smell of fire. It is
warming, astringent, and purges away those things that
darken the eyesight and consume the flesh on the
eyelids, and all other abnormal fleshy growths. They
regard the scissile as more effective than the round. They
are burnt and roasted like chalcitis [calcium carbonate].
With vinegar or honey they restrain creeping ulcers, stop
bloody discharges, close moist gums, and they
strengthen loose teeth. They are good with honey for
apthae [ aptylia — absence of saliva], and with juice of
polygonum [knotgrass] for pustules and rheumatic
discharges in the ears. They are good with brassica leaves
(or boiled with honey) for leprosy; and are applied with
hot cloths and water for itches, rotten nails, pterygium
[membrane on eye], and chilblains. With vinegar
sediment (rubbed on with the same amount of burnt galls 
[oak galls]) they are good for eating ulcers. They are used
 806
METALLIC STONES

with twice as much salt for gangrenous ulceration, and
smeared on with ervum [2-129, 2-131] and moist pitch
they wear off dandruff. Rubbed on with water it is a
remedy for nits, lice and burns. They are smeared on for
oedema and bad smells in the armpits and groins. Allom
from Melos (laid at the mouth of the womb before sexual
intercourse) also prevents conception and it is an
abortifacient. It is expedient for abnormal growths on the
gums, as well as for the uvula, tonsils, and the mouth,
and is smeared on with honey for the ears and genitals.
5-124. THEION
SUGGESTED: Sulphur
The best sulphur is thought to have never felt fire and
is glistening in colour, transparent, and without
stones. The best of that which has felt the fire is green and 
very fat. It is abundant in Melos and Lipara. The first type
of sulphur dissolves and ripens quickly. Taken in an egg
(or else the smoke inhaled) it is good for coughs, those
who spit rotten matter, and the asthmatic. Furthermore,
the smoke is inhaled as an abortifacient; and mixed with
terminthos [1-91] rosin it takes off leprosy, lichen [ skin
disease with red pustules] and rotten nails. Smeared on
with vinegar it is also good for leprosy and takes away
vitiligines [form of leprosy]. Mixed with rosin it heals
scorpion strikes, and with vinegar it heals strikes from sea 
dragons [2-15] as well as scorpions. Rubbed on with
saltpetre [potassium nitrate] it soothes itching all over the 
body. A spoonful sprinkled on the forehead (or taken
with an undercooked egg) helps jaundice, and is good for 
the nose and catarrh. Sprinkled on, it keeps one from
sweating, and smeared on with saltpetre [potassium
nitrate] and water it is convenient for gout. The smoke
from it drawn up (quickly) through a funnel cures
hardness of hearing. The smoke is inhaled for lethargy,
and it stops excessive discharges of blood. Smeared on
with wine and honey it heals bruises on the ears. 
 807
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

5-125. KISSERIS
SUGGESTED: Pumice Stone
Pumice stone should be chosen which is very light,
very hollow, easily cut, without stones, and
furthermore both brittle and white. It is burnt as follows.
Take as much of it as you wish, hide it in burning coals,
and when it is red-hot, take it out, quench it with fragrant
wine, then burn it and quench it again. The third time
you take it off, leave it alone to cool, and put it in jars to
use. It is able to tighten and cleanse the gums, purge
away things that darken the eyesight with warming, fill
up ulcers and form new skins on them, and furthermore,
pounded to powder, it is able to repress abnormal
growths and clean the teeth. It forms scabs over any sores
on the body, and is a suitable medicine to remove hair.
Theophrastus says that if one puts pumice stone into a jar 
of boiling wine that the boiling immediately stops. 
5-126. ALES
SUGGESTED: Salts — Sodium Chloride, Ammonium Salts
Mineral salt is the most useful — usually that which
is without stones, white, transparent, thick and
equally compacted — as well as ammonia salts, which are 
easily cut and have straight edges. Thick sea salt must be
taken, white and even. The best is from Salamine in
Cyprus, Megara, Sicily, and Africa. Salt from the lakes in
these places is considered the best. The Phrygian is the
strongest, also called Tattaean. These salts all have similar 
properties — useful as an astringent, and to clean and
dissolve, as well as repress, reduce the intensity of
symptoms, and form scabs — only differing slightly.
They are binding for rotten ulcers, mixed with sebaceous
treatments for psoriasis, repress abnormal growths in the
eyes, and consume pterygium [membrane on eye]. They
take away other abnormal growths, are fit to put in
suppositories, and smeared on with oil they remove
weariness and oedema from dropsy. Warm packs are
made from them in little bags to ease pain, and rubbed on 
by the fire with oil and vinegar (until the person sweats)
they lessen itching. In the same way (rubbed on with
 808
METALLIC STONES

honey and vinegar) they lessen lichen [skin disease with
red pustules], parasitical skin diseases, leprosy, and a
synanchic [ abscessed] throat. For the tonsils and
adenoids they are roasted with honey, and for spreading
ulcers, apthas [small ulcers], and moisture of the gums
they are applied burnt with polenta. For the strikes of
scorpions they are used with flax seed; for the bites of
vipers with origanum, honey and hyssop [3-30]; for the
horned viper with pitch, cedria [1-105] or honey; and for
the bites of centipedes or millipedes with honey and
vinegar. For wasp stings, gnawing worms, white
pustules in the head, the thymus, and tubercles
[growths] they take it with calves’ suet. With raisins,
swines’ grease or honey they dissolve boils
[inflammatory tumours]; and with origanum and
fermented dough they ripen oedema of the genitals
sooner. They help those bitten by crocodiles, pounded
into small pieces and bound in a linen cloth dipped in
vinegar and then bound to the wounds with bandages. 
With honey they help those bitten by venomous
creatures, and bruises on the face. As an antidote for
drinking the juice of poppy or eating mushrooms it is
taken as a drink with vinegar and honey. They are used
for dislocations with meal and honey; and applied with
oil do not allow burns to blister. Salts are similarly applied 
to gout and earache with vinegar. Smeared on with
vinegar (or applied as a poultice with hyssop [3-30]) they
stop erysipela [streptococcal skin infection] and creeping
ulcers. They burn salts by throwing them into an ostracean
[clay] jar, carefully closed so that they may not leap out,
and then hidden in live coals until fully burnt. Some
wrap the sales fossiles [mineral salt] with dough, place it
under hot coals, and leave it alone until the dough has
burnt. You may burn common salts as follows; wash
them once in water and allow them to dry, then put them
into a corked ceramic pot and make a fire underneath,
shaking the pot until the salt no longer leaps. 
5-127. ALOS ACHNE
SUGGESTED: Sea Froth
Spuma salis are fragments of the foaming sea found on
the little rocks, and it has the same properties as salt.
 809
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

5-128. ALME
SUGGESTED: Muriates — Chloride Salts
Muria has the same action as ordinary salts in
cleansing, and it is a suppository for dysentery
with gangrenous ulceration, and those with a history of
sciatica. It is good in warm packs where seawater is
effective.
5-129. ALOS ANTHOS
SUGGESTED: Mineral Salts
Flowers of salt [precipitated solids] flow down from the
river Nile and collect on certain lakes. That like
saffron in colour must be taken. It has a somewhat bad
scent like garum [Roman sauce made from fermented
fish], sometimes smelling worse; more biting to the taste
and somewhat fat. That coloured with red ochre (or has
clots) is considered worthless. The pure salts are only
dissolved by oil, the adulterated partly by water. It is
good for malignancies, spreading erosive ulcers,
gangrenous ulcers on the genitals, purulent ears, and
dullness of sight, and it takes off scars and cataracts. It is
mixed with plasters and ointments to colour them, as
well as with rosaceum [1-53]. Taken with wine and water it 
promotes sweating, disturbs the intestines, and is bad for
the stomach. It is also mixed with remedies for the
removal of fatigue, and with sebaceous treatments for
reducing the intensity of symptoms of the scalp, and in
general it is as sharply burning as other salts.
5-130. NITRON
SUGGESTED: Saltpetre — Potassium Nitrate
Nitre is preferred which is smooth and rosy or white
in colour, with holes through as though it were
some spongy thing, like that which is brought from Buni.
It has an ability to fetch fluids from the depths.
 810
METALLIC STONES

5-131. NITROU APHROS
SUGGESTED: Potassium Nitrate — Saltpetre — Spuma Nitri
The best spuma nitri is esteemed to be the lightest —
crusty, brittle, and drawing to a purple, frothy, and
moreover biting. Such as this is brought from
Philadelphia in Lydia. Next to this is that from Egypt. It is
also found in Magnesia which is in Caria, and both this
and nitre [above] have a similar burning strength, like
salt. Furthermore, pounded into small pieces with cumin, 
and taken as a drink with honey water (or sapa [syruped
new wine], or some things to dissolve wind such as rue
[3-52, 3-53, 4-98] or dill [3-67]) it soothes griping. It is a fit
ointment for those troubled with recurrent fevers, given
before the suspected time of the fit coming. It is mixed
with dissolving and drawing plasters good for leprosy,
and with things that relieve. Infused with warm water or
wine it heals gaseousness, as well as noises in the ears and 
their suppurations. Dropped in the ears with vinegar it
takes away their filth. With ass or swine grease it heals
dog bites. It opens boils [inflammatory tumours] taken
with termininthos [5-39]; and with figs it is a poultice for
dropsy. Smeared on with honey it is a sight restorer, and
it is good (taken as a drink with posca [hot drinks]) for the
ingestion of mushrooms [ antidote]. It is given against
bupressedis [buprestidae — beetles, harmful to cattle] with
water, and for bulls’ blood with silphium [3-94]. It is an
effective poultice for those in atrophy, and is used with
wax ointment for tetanus sufferings that cause some
weakening, and for purifying baths. It is effective mixed
in their bread for those who have palsy in the tongue.
Some burn these salts, setting them on burning coals (a
new clay jar first placed under) until completely burnt.
5-132. TRUX
SUGGESTED: Sediment of Wine, Sediment of Vinegar
Especially that sediment from old Italian wine must be 
chosen, and if not some other like it, because that
from vinegar is excessively strong. It is burnt like
alcyonium [5-136] but first dried carefully. Some place it in
new clay (jars) and burn it in a great fire until it is burnt
 811
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

quite through. Similarly, others hide the mass (of
sediment) in burning coals. It is a sign that it is completely 
burnt when it is white or the colour of air. This, applied to
the tongue, burns it. The sediment of vinegar is burnt the
same way. It is extremely burning, cleans and forms new
skins; it is astringent, and extremely corrosive and
drying. We must use sediment that is new, for it quickly
evaporates and should be kept in jars — never
uncovered, nor without a jar. It is washed the same as
pompholyx [crude zinc oxide]. That which is not burnt
restrains oedema (both by itself or with myrtle [1-155,
4-146]), and applied it stops the intestines and flowing
stomach. It soothes women's excessive discharges
[menstrual flow] applied to the lower part of the
intestines and the genitals. It dissolves inflammation in
bones and lesser swellings that are not yet ulcerated.
Rubbed on with vinegar it reduces swollen breasts that
run out with milk. Burnt with rosin it takes off rotten
nails, and it is smeared on with lentiscine [1-90] oil for a
whole night to make hair yellow. It is washed and mixed
with eye medicines like spodium [calcinated powder], and 
this removes scars and darkness in the eyes.
5-133. ASBESTOS
SUGGESTED: Quicklime — Calx Viva 
Asbestos refers to `the unquenchable stone’ — the action of cold water on
quicklime.
Calx viva  is made as follows. Take the shells of sea
creatures called buccinae [whelks], cover them in the
fire or place them into a thoroughly hot oven, and let
them remain there all night and the next day. If they have 
turned very white take them out, but if not, repeat until
they are white. Afterwards dip them in cold water and
put them into a new pot, corked carefully with cloths.
Leave them in there for one night and in the morning
take them out, and after it has been refined, put it in jars.
It is also made from flints or pebble stones that are burnt,
and from common marble, which is also preferred. All
calx in common is fiery, biting, burning and scab forming.
Mixed with certain other things such as grease or oil, it
 812
METALLIC STONES

becomes digestive, softening and dissipating, forming
new skins. They regard the newest and that which was
never wet to be the most effective.
5-134. GUPSOS 
SUGGESTED: Gypsum — Plaster of Paris
Gypsum is astringent, closes pores, and restrains
bleeding and sweating. Taken in a drink it chokes
by constriction.
5-135. TEPHRA KLEMATINE
SUGGESTED: Ash from twigs or prunings
Cinis sarmentitius  is caustic. Smeared on with goose
grease or oil it is good for bruised sinews, dislocated
joints and knotted nerves. With saltpetre [potassium
nitrate] and vinegar it represses fleshy abnormal growths 
in the scrotum, and smeared on with vinegar it heals the
bites of snakes or dogs. It is mixed with scab-forming
medicines. Lye is made from it, good for precipitations
[antidotes to mercury poisoning], and [the effects of]
mushrooms, used with vinegar, salt and honey.
5-136. ALKUONION
SUGGESTED: Alcyonium — Zoophyte — Bastard Sponge
There are five kinds of alcyonium. One kind is thick
with a sour taste. It looks like a sponge, is poisonous
and heavy, and smells of fish. A lot of this is found on the
shores. The next is shaped like pterygium [membrane] of
the eyes, and is light and hollow in many places, or like a
sponge and with a smell like seaweed. The third is
shaped like a little worm, a deeper purple in colour, and
is called milesium. The fourth is like unwashed wool,
hollow in many places, and light. The fifth is the shape of
a mushroom, without smell, and rough, somewhat like a
pumice stone within, but smooth and sharp outside.
Quantities of it are found in Propontis around the island
called Besbicum, in which country they call it the foam of
 813
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

the sea. Of these, the first and second are included in
sebaceous treatments for women, and for freckles, lichen
[papular skin disease], leprosy, vitiligines [form of
leprosy], black patches, and spots on the face and the rest
of the body. The third is suitable to use for dysuria
[frequent painful urination], those who gather gravelly
stones in the bladder, kidney disorders, dropsy and
spleen. Burnt and smeared on with wine it thickens the
loss of hair [alopecia]. The last type is able to whiten teeth.
It is mixed with salt and included in other sebaceous
treatments and psilothra [treatments for loss of hair]. If
you want to burn any of these put it with salt into an
unfired clay pot, and having sealed around the mouth of
it with clay, put it into a furnace. When the clay pot has
baked enough take it out, put it in jars, and use it. It is
washed like cadmia [5-84]. 
5-137. ADARKES 
SUGGESTED: Potassium Sulphate — Arcanum Duplicatum 
 IRRITANT, CATHARTIC
That which is called adarces grows in Galatia and it is
(as it were) a somewhat salty hardened fluid, coming
out of moist and marshy places in times of drought and
adhering to reeds and grass. It is like the flower [salt] of the 
stone of Asia in colour, but in its whole shape like
alcyonium [5-136], soft and hollow in many places (and as
it were) alcyonium palustre  [bastard sponges of the
marshes]. It suitable used for stripping off leprosy,
freckles, lichenae [skin disease], and other similar things.
In brief, it is sharp, drawing fluids from depths, and it is
good for sciatica. 
5-138. SPOGGOI
SUGGESTED: Sponges
Sponges are sometimes called males when they are
thick and full of small holes. The hardest of these they 
have named tragi. The others are called females and are
different. They are burnt the same way as alcyonium
[5-136]. Those empty and without fat are good for
 814
METALLIC STONES

wounds, repress oedema, and with water or posca [hot
drinks] they seal new wounds; boiled with honey they
rejoin old wounds. Old sponges are of no use. Sponges
open contracted ulcers and calluses, bound with a thread
and put in dry like tents. They dry up flowing
undermining ulcers and old ulcers, applied dry, new and
empty; and they restrain excessive discharges of blood.
Burnt with vinegar they are good for dry sore eyes,
anywhere there is need to clean, and are astringent for
anything. They are better for eye medicines if they are
washed. Burnt with pitch they are good for excessive
discharges of blood. The softest of them are whitened in
the burning heat of summer, moistened with froth of salt
standing on the rocks, and placed in the sun. But take
care that the hollow side of them faces upward and the
cut side is underneath. If it is clear summer weather they
are also moistened with froth of salt or seawater and set
out under the moon. These are the whitest.
5-139. KORALLION
SUGGESTED: Coral
Coral seems to be a sea plant which hardens when it is 
drawn out of the deep — taken out of the sea and as
it were, dipped into the air flowing all around us. Great
amounts of it are found in the promontory called
Pachynum near Syracuse. The best is red like sandarac
[5-122] or sandyx [ancient red pigment], a very intense
colour. This is easy to pound; even [textured] throughout 
its whole concretion, with a mossy smell like little
seaweed, and with many branches, imitating cinnamon
in the form of little shrubs. That hardened like stone,
rough, without colour, hollow and loose, is thought to be
worthless. By its strength it is therapeutic for the bowels,
cools gently, represses abnormal growths, takes off scars
on the eyes, fills up hollow sores and cracks, works
effectively against spitting up blood, is good for frequent
painful urination, and (taken as a drink with water)
reduces the spleen. Some have called it lithodendron
[stone tree].
 815
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

5-140. ANTIPATHES
SUGGESTED: Black Coral
Antipathes is thought to be coral with a specific
difference: it is black in colour. This is also like a tree
only more branched, and it has the same strength as that
mentioned above.
5-141. PHRUGIOS LITHOS
UNKNOWN
The Phrygian stone the dyers in Phrygia use (hence its
name) is found in Cappadocia. The best is pale and
mildly heavy, not firm from compaction, with partitions
of white in-between like cadmia [5-84]. The stone is burnt
as follows. Moisten it with the best wine, cover it with live 
coals, and blow on it continuously. When it changes
colour to a more deep yellow, take it out, quench it with
the same wine, place it into the coals again, then do the
same things and burn it a third time, taking care that it
does not crumble and vanish into soot. Both raw and
burnt it is effective with stiff ointment for binding,
cleaning, forming scabs, and healing burns. It is washed
like cadmia [5-84].
5-142. ASIOS LITHOS
UNKNOWN
Asian stone should be taken which is like pumice
stone in colour — spongy, light and brittle, with
yellowish partitions at the bottom. The flower [salt] of it is
the yellowish salt fluid which gathers on the outside of
the stones, which is thin in consistency and sometimes
white in colour, sometimes like pumice stone, inclining to 
a yellow. Applied to the tongue it bites a little. Both of
them are astringent, corrode gently, and dissolve small
swellings used with terminthos [1-91] rosin or liquid pitch,
and the flower [salt] is considered the strongest.
Furthermore, dried, it heals old hard-to-close ulcers,
represses abnormal fleshy growths, and with honey it
cleans those like mushrooms, and wild ulcers. It fills the
 816
METALLIC STONES

hollow sores of ulcers and cleans them with honey, and
mixed with wax ointment it stops feeding ulcers. For gout 
it is used in plasters with bean meal, and for the spleen
with vinegar and unslaked lime [quicklime — calx viva].
The flower [salt] (licked in with honey) is good for
tuberculosis of the lungs. Stone baths are made from this
into which the gouty put in their feet and are helped, and
coffins are made of it that dissolve flesh. It relieves very
fleshy and thick bodies [weight loss] smeared on instead
of saltpetre [potassium nitrate] in a bath. If you want to
wash it do it in the same way as cadmia [5-84]. 
5-143. PURITES LITHOS
SUGGESTED: Pyrites — Iron Disilphide 
Pyrites is a kind of stone from which brass is made.
That with a look like brass and which readily sends
out sparks should be taken. It is burnt as follows. Moisten
it with honey, put it into a soft coal fire, and blow on it
continuously until it becomes a yellowish colour. Some
put the stone (well moistened with honey) into many hot
burning coals, then when it begins to change to a tawny
yellow they take it off, blow off the ashes, moisten it, and
burn it again until it becomes very brittle throughout. For
it is often burnt only on the outside. They burn it like this,
dry it, and put it in jars. It should be washed like cadmia
[5-84] if there is a need to wash it. Either burnt or raw it is
warming and purging, cleaning away things that darken
the sight, and dissolving and ripening hard lumps. Taken 
with rosin it represses abnormal fleshy growths by
warming a little and by its astringency. Some call burnt
pyrites, diphryges [above].
5-144. AIMATITES LITHOS
SUGGESTED: Haematite — Iron Sesquioxide
The best haematite stone is brittle and has a deep
colour, or is black and hard and even, not containing
any impurities or veins. It is astringent, somewhat
warming, and reduces the intensity of symptoms. With
honey it wears off scars and scabs on the eyes. With
woman’s milk it helps sore eyes and broken bloodshot
 817
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

eyes. It is taken in a drink with wine for painful urination, 
and women’s discharges [ menstrual flow] with
pomegranate juice, and for spitting-up blood. Eye salves
are made of it, and suppositories and touchstones
suitable for eye complaints. It is burnt like Phrygian
[dyer's] stone, only the wine omitted. It is properly burnt
when it is mildly light and swollen up with bubbles.
Some counterfeit it as follows. They take a piece of
schistus [crystalline laminated rock], thick and round
(such as those called the roots of it) and cover it in a
big-bellied earthen jar containing hot ash. Then they
leave it a little while, take it out, and rub it on a
touchstone testing whether it has taken the colour of
haematites, and if it has they put it in jars. If not they cover
it again, continuously looking at it and testing it, for if left
too long in the ashes it changes colour and dissolves. That 
which is adulterated is confirmed first by the veins
running through it, for this is has straight veins but
haematites does not; then by the colour for this has a
bright colour, the haematites a deeper one like cinnabar
[5-109]. It is also found in Sinopican red ochre, and
haematites is made from lodestone [magnetic oxide of
iron] burnt very well; but that which occurs naturally is
dug out of mines in Egypt. 
5-145. SCHISTOS LITHOS
SUGGESTED: Crystalline Laminated Rock
Schistos stone is found in Spain towards the west. That
which looks like saffron in colour seems to be the best
— brittle, easy to clean, compacted like amoniacum salt,
with similar veins. It has the same uses as haematite only
with less strength. Diluted with women’s milk it fills up
hollow sores, and it is very effective for hernia, prolapse
of the eyes, thickness of the eyelids, and staphylomata
[protrusion of the cornea]. 
5-146. GAGATES LITHOS
SUGGESTED: Gagate — Jet or Agate
Gagates is preferred which is kindled quickly and
smells like bitumen. It is commonly black,
 818
METALLIC STONES

unattractive, crusty and very light. It softens and
dissolves. If the smoke is inhaled it induces epilepsy and
calms women who are hysterical. It is mixed with
medicines for gout and those to remove fatigue, and
smoke from it drives away snakes. It is found in Cilicia at
a certain fall of the river flowing into the sea near the city
called Plagiopolis. The place and the river at the mouth of 
which these stones are found are called Gagas. (They say
that it discerns holy suffering, for if smelt when carried
down to the earth they fall suddenly. Perfumed, it heals
hidden disorders of women if they take in the vapour.) 
5-147. THRAKIAS LITHOS
UNKNOWN
Thracius is found in Scythia near the river Pontus. It
can perform the same cures as gagates [above] and it
is said to be set on fire with water and quenched with oil,
which is also done with asphalt [bitumen — asphalt —
mineral pitch].
5-148. MAGNES
SUGGESTED: Magnetite — Magnetic Iron Oxide 
That lodestone which draws iron easily is the best,
with an azure colour [blue], and thick but not too
heavy. It is able to draw out thick fluids if thirty grains are
given with honey and water. (They say that this can
discern a woman who is chaste from one that plays the
adulteress with another man, for if it is placed secretly on
the bed of a chaste woman who loves her husband, she
when overcome with sleep, with a certain natural
strength from the stone, opens her hands towards her
husband and lies close to him. The other, troubled in
dreams with foul labours, falls out of bed. When two men 
carry this, it frees them from all strife and causes
harmony, and when worn on the chest it soothes people).
 819
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

5-149. ARABIKOS LITHOS
UNKNOWN
Arabicus stone is like a piece of ivory. Pounded into
small pieces and smeared on it dries up
haemorrhoids, and burnt it is a dentifrice for the teeth.  
5-150. GALAKTITES LITHOS
UNKNOWN
This is called galactites because it exudes milky stuff. It
is like ash in colour and sweet to the taste. It is good
rubbed on for discharges and ulcers of the eyes. It is
necessary that those who beat it in water put it in jars in a
lead box because of its glueyness.
5-151. MELITITES LITHOS
SUGGESTED: Melelite — Calcium Silicate, Aluminum Silicate
Melitites is like galactites [above] in all respects,
differing only in that it exudes a sweeter liquid. It is 
effective for the same things as galactites. It is also called
galactites and lethaeus because men carrying it and going
to their own masters find them well disposed and
forgetful of wrongs (often committed). When the milk of
goats and sheep dry up it helps the little flock if it is
beaten finely and mixed with brine. They say that
pounded and taken as a drink it can do the same for
women to produce milk. They say that bound around the 
neck of an infant it keeps him free from envy and
diseases, and keeps the infant from treachery, and that
both kings and judges revere anyone that wears this, and
that they seem grandiose to all men. 
5-152. MOROCHTHOS LITHOS
SUGGESTED: Moroxis — crystallised form of Apatite 
— Phosphate of Lime — Calcium Oxide
Morochthus stone (which some call galaxia or
leucographis) is found in Egypt. Those who make
 820
METALLIC STONES

linen use it for whitening cloth as it is soft and melting. It
is thought to close the pores, and is good taken as a drink
with water for bloodspitters, the abdominal cavity, and
disorders of the bladder. The same is given for the
menstrual flows of women, and also in a pessary. It is
mixed with softening eye medicines as it fills up hollow
sores and stops discharges. Used with wax ointment it
forms a scar on the tenderness of ulcers.
5-153. ALABASTRITES LITHOS
SUGGESTED: Alabaster — Lime Sulphate 
 Onyx-banded quartz similar to Agate
Alabastrites stone (which is called onyx) used burnt
with rosin or pitch dissolves hard lumps. With stiff
ointment it eases disorders of the stomach, and it is
therapeutic for the gums.
5-154. THUITES LITHOS
SUGGESTED: Thyites — Turquoise
Thyites is found in Ethiopia. It is greenish like jasper
[previously this was green chalcedony], and when
washed produces a milky colour. It is extremely biting,
and is able to clean away things that darken the pupils. 
5-155. IOUDAIKOS LITHOS
UNKNOWN
Judaican stone is found in Judaea, shaped like a glans
[acorn], white, with a very handsome shape, and lines
parallel to one another as if made by turning. When it is
dissolved, it yields no taste. An amount like a cicer [2-126],
dissolved like a cream on a whetstone and taken with
three cupfuls of warm water as a drink can help painful
urination, and break stones in the bladder. 
 821
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

5-156. AMIANTOS LITHOS
SUGGESTED: Amianthus — Asbestos, fibrous green Chrysolite
Amiantus stone is found in Cyprus. It is like alumen
scissile [5-123] which the workmen make webs of
cloth from for a show, because put into the fire they take
flame, but come out more bright, not burnt by the fire. 
5-157. SAPHEIROS LITHOS
SUGGESTED: Sapphire — previously Lapis Lazuli — Alumina
Sapphire stone is thought to be good (taken in a drink)
for those touched by scorpions. It is also taken in a
drink for internal ulcers and abnormal growths in the
eyes; it represses adenoids [ haemorrhoids?] and
pustules, and rejoins herniated membranes. 
5-158. MEMPHITES LITHOS
UNKNOWN
Memphitis stone is found in Egypt near Memphis —
the size of a pebble, fat, and of various colours. It is
said that this (pounded into small pieces and smeared on
any place that shall be cut or burnt), causes numbness
[anaesthetic] without danger. 
5-159. SELENITES LITHOS
SUGGESTED: Selenite — Moonstone 
— crystalline Lime Sulphate
Selenites stone some have called aphroselenon because it
is found in the nighttime during the increase of the
moon. It is found in Arabia and is white, transparent and
light. They file it and give the dust in a drink to the
epileptic. Women hang it about themselves as an amulet,
and it is thought that bound to trees it makes them bear
fruit. 
 822
METALLIC STONES

5-160. IASPIS LITHOS
SUGGESTED: Jasper — previously name for green Chalcedony
Some jaspis stone is like emerald and some like crystal,
resembling phlegm; some like the air and some capnia
as we should say, smoky; and some called assyrius is
glittering, with white middle partitions. Some is called
terebinthizusa as it is coloured like calais. All are said to be
amulets used as personal ornaments, and to speed
delivery [in childbirth] tied to the thigh. 
5-161. AETITES LITHOS
SUGGESTED: Eagle Stone — Iron Oxide
hollow nodule of argilaceous Iron Oxide with a loose nucleus
Aetites stone when shaken sends out a sound as if it
were pregnant with another stone. It prevents
miscarriage when the wombs are slippery, tied around
the left arm. At the time of delivery [in childbirth] take it
from the arm and tie it around the thigh and she shall
bring forth without pain. It exposes a thief if it is put into
the bread offered him, for he that stole is not able to
swallow down the things chewed. They say that aetites
boiled together with meat will betray a thief, for he who
stole shall not be able to swallow that which was boiled
with it. Pounded into small pieces and used in a wax
ointment made of cyprinum  [1-65], gleucinum [1-67] or
any of those things that warm, it helps epilepsy
considerably.
5-162. OPHITES LITHOS
SUGGESTED: Serpentine 
green metamorphic rock or marble
One kind of ophites stone is heavy and black, another
an ashy colour distinguished with pricks, and
another with white lines. Any of them (tied about the
body) is good for snakebites and headaches. That with
lines is reported to help lethargy and headaches in
particular.
 823
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

5-163. LITHOI SPOGGON
SUGGESTED: Stones found in Sponges
Stones found in sponges (taken as a drink with wine)
break stones in the bladder.
5-164. LITHOKOLLA
SUGGESTED: Lithocolla — Marble & Glue
literally glue stone 
Lithocolla — a mixture of marble or Parian stone and
bulls glue — used as a probe made red-hot is able to
turn back the eyelashes. 
5-165. OSTRAKITES LITHOS
SUGGESTED: Fossilised Oyster Shells
Ostracites stone is like a shell, crusty and easy to
break. Women use it instead of pumice stone for
taking off hair. A teaspoonful (taken as a drink with wine) 
stops the menstrual flow. If anyone drinks two
teaspoonfuls after the menstrual flow it prevents
conception. Applied with honey it soothes inflamed
breasts, and stops gangrenous ulceration of the cheeks.
5-166. SMURIS LITHOS
SUGGESTED: opaque crystallised Alumina 
— Adamantine Spar— Emery, Corundum 
Jewelers to polish their stones use Smyris lapis. It is good
for antiseptic and caustic medicines, and for moist
gums and cleaning the teeth. 
 824
METALLIC STONES

5-167. AMMOS
SUGGESTED: Sand
Sand heated by the sun on the shores dries up the
moisture of dropsy in bodies when they are covered
all over with it, except the head. It is roasted for dry warm 
packs instead of millet or salt. 
5-168. AKONE
SUGGESTED: Whetstone 
fine grained stone for sharpening blades
That which comes off the Naxian whetstone (when
iron is rubbed on it) fills up bald patches with hair,
and prevents maidens’ breasts growing big. Taken as a
drink with vinegar it reduces the spleen, and is good for
epilepsy. 
5-169. GEODES LITHOS
SUGGESTED: Geodes 
nodular stones with crystalline cavities
Geodes are astringent and drying, and take away
things that darken the eyes. Smeared on [ground
up] with water they soothe inflammation of the breasts,
and that from stones [urinary, kidney]. 
5-170. GE
SUGGESTED: Earth
All earth that falls within the scope of medicinal use is
supremely useful for cooling, and for closing the
pores. There are various kinds, some good for other
things in some preparations. 
 825
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

5-171. ERETRIAS
SUGGESTED: Alkaline Earths; Baryta — Barium monoxide;
Lime — Calcium oxide; Strontia — Strontium monoxide
Some Eretrian earth is considerably white and some is
an ashy colour. The best is that which resembles ash
in colour, and is very soft, and when drawn along brass
yields a violet line. It is washed like cerussa [white lead
ore] or as follows. Pound as much as you want of it into
small pieces (first by itself and then with water) and let it
settle. Then strain out the moisture gently, dry the earth
in the sun, beat it again for a whole day (adding water)
and allow it to settle all night. About the break of day
strain it, pound it finely in the sun, and form it into
tablets, as far as possible. If there is a need to roast it take
(pieces) of earth the size of a cicer [2-126], put it into a clay
jar of full of holes, and having corked the mouth
carefully, put it among lighted coals and blow on it
continuously. When the ashes have turned into sparks
(or rather become an airy colour), take it out and put it in
jars. It is astringent, cooling, and gently softening, filling
up hollow sores, and closing open cuts and bleeding
wounds. 
5-172. SAMIA
SUGGESTED: Alkaline Earths; Baryta — Barium monoxide;
Lime — Calcium oxide; Strontia — Strontium monoxide;
Aster — Asteria — Asteriated Sapphire, Chrysoberyl
Samian earth is preferred which is very white and
light, and on touching the tongue holds it fast like
glue. Additionally it is full of liquid, soft and brittle, such
as that which some call collyrium [eye salve, suppository].
There are two kinds; besides that previously mentioned
there is one called aster, crusty and thick like whetstone. It 
has the same properties and is burnt and broken like
eretrias [5-171]. It stops the spitting up of blood, and is
given with flowers of wild pomegranate for women’s
menstrual flows. Smeared on with water it soothes
inflammation from stones [ urinary, kidney], and
inflammation of the breasts. Taken in a drink of water it
 826
METALLIC STONES

represses sweating; it helps those bitten by venomous
creatures, and those who have taken a deadly medicine
[antidote]. 
5-173. LITHOS SAMIOS
UNKNOWN
A certain stone is found in Samia that the goldsmiths
use to polish and make the gold glistening. The best
is white and heavy. It is astringent and cooling, good for
stomach disorders in drinks, dulling the senses. It is good
with milk for discharges and ulcers in the eyes, and it is
thought to hasten delivery [ childbirth], and prevent
miscarriage in women that have conceived, tied around
them.
5-174. CHIA
SUGGESTED: Chian Earth — ? Bicarbonate of Soda
Earth also means metallic oxides i.e. Magnesia, Alumina, Zirconia.
Chian earth which is white and almost an ashy colour
like the Samian [above] should be used. It is crusty
and white and differs in the shape of its particles. It has
the same properties as Samian earth. It makes the face
and the whole body without wrinkles and clear, and
used in a bath instead of saltpetre [potassium nitrate] it
scours.
5-175. SELINOUSIA
UNKNOWN
Selinusian earth does the same things [as those above].
The best glitters extremely, is white and brittle, and
very quickly dissolved if it gets wet.
 827
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

5-176. KIMOLIA
SUGGESTED: Cimolite — soft hydrous Alumina Silicate 
Some Cimolian earth is white, and some inclining to a
purple with a certain fattiness to it, and somewhat
cold to the touch. This is considered the best. Both sorts
(diluted with vinegar) dissolve inflammation of the
parotid gland, and the second type dissolves lesser
tumours. They are good for burns, rubbed on by hand to
keep the affected parts from blistering. They suppress
hardness from stones [ urinary, kidney], and
inflammation on any part of the body; furthermore they
withstand erysipela [streptococcal skin infection], and in
brief the genuine are of much use if the bastard ones are
not taken. 
5-177. PNIGITIS
UNKNOWN
Pnigitis earth in a way resembles Eretrian earth [5-171] 
in colour. It is thickly crusted, cooling if touched by
the hands, and adheres to the tongue very much so that it 
hangs on it. It has the same properties as fuller's earth
[ammonium silicate] except for its strength. Some sell this 
as Eretrian earth.
5-178. OSTRAKA
Clay Tiles
The tiles in furnaces that are very burnt are crust-
forming: as a result (rubbed on with vinegar) they
heal itching and pustules breaking out, and are good for
gout. Used with wax ointments they dissolve scrofulous
tumours [glandular swelling] and goitres.
 828
METALLIC STONES

5-179. GE KAMINON
Burnt Red Earth
Well-burnt red earth from furnaces has the same
qualities as the tiles [above]. 
5-180. GE MELIA
Earth from Melia
Melia is coloured like Eretrian earth (which is an ashy 
colour) but it is rough, and rubbed with the fingers
it makes a creaking noise like pumice stone that is being
grated. It is like allom [5-123] in quality but somewhat
more weak, which is also shown by the taste. It dries the
tongue gently. It is able to make the body clean and a
good colour, thins hair, and wears off alphos
[non-contagious leprosy] and psoriasis. It is useful for
painters to make their colours more permanent, and it is
helpful in green [herbal] plasters. Earth of any type
should be chosen which is without stones, new, soft,
brittle, and easily dissolved when it touches moisture. 
5-181. GE AMPELITIS
SUGGESTED: Ampelite — Bituminous Earth
Amphelitis earth (also called pharmacitis) is found in
Seleucia near Syria. The black should be chosen. It is
like small coals from a pitch tree, adhering like a lath [?]
and glistening the same. Furthermore, it is melted slowly
if a little oil is poured on it while it is pounded into small
pieces. That which is white, ashy and unmeltable is
considered worthless. It dissolves and cools. It is used to
make eyelids beautiful, for dyeing hair, and for rubbing
the vines at the time of their sprouting, for it kills worms
that breed in them.
 829
    THE HERBAL OF DIOSCORIDES THE GREEK

5-182. ASBOLE
Soot from glass-making
Fuligio pictoria [soot] that the painters use is taken from
the glassmakers, as that is the best. It is putrifying and 
sharp, and with a waxy ointment of rosaceum [1-53] it
heals fractures.
5-183. MELAN
Black Ink
The ink with which we write is prepared from the soot
gathered from torches, and to each ounce of gum is
mixed three ounces of soot. It is also made from the soot
of rosin, and the previously mentioned soot pictoria. Mix
one pound of soot pictoria, half a pound of gum, half an
ounce of bulls’ glue, and half an ounce of chalcanthum
[blue vitriol or copper sulphate]. It is good included in
antiseptic medicines; and for burns it is rubbed on thickly 
with water and left alone until it forms new skins, for it
falls off of its own accord when the sores have healed. 
And so, most loving Areius, to have stored up well
near as much as we thought suitable and to be of a
large composition additionally and of information of
matters medicinal and their uses, let this suffice.
